I have recently been posting the lies you have repeatedly told me on my social networks, reaching &gt;800 readers, and I have been shocked with how many of my friends were also disappointed.  It seems that if you hired a few competent people rather than an army of customer service people trying to clean up their incompetence, you wouldn't have to market so hard because people would recommend you.  Today marks 98 days since you installed your panels on my house.  I was promised hook up in 4 - 6 weeks, then in 9 - 12 weeks, and yesterday, a jerk in your deparment said, \"We have now changed our estimate to 23 weeks, so see?  We're still ahead of schedule.\"   This man, Keith Wilson, was the biggest liar of all, and rather than admitting your failure to honor your end of the contract, he blithely said that you had unilaterally changed the contract, and by your new terms, you were ahead of schedule.  I am now working with a television investigator who looks set to help me warn thousands of other homeowners to avoid Vivint in the future.  Wish someone had warned me!!",

It has now been 14 WEEKS since the day it was installed and I'm now being told it will be another \"few\" weeks before I can SCHEDULE a city inspection. I'm sure it will be another \"few\" weeks after that before I can actually use the system. At this point, I am extremely upset about all the false or surprise information I have been given.

HE DID NEITHER!!!!!   DID NOT RETURN THE KEY OR LOCK THE GATE LEAVING YARD OPEN TO ALL!!!  Can't help but wonder if he's made a copy of the key  intending to come back and steal (or worse).  Have called you guys and demanded to know what's going on and to get my key back.  OF COURSE, as Vivint is wont to do, no call received.  Will call the police and inform them that if anything happens here, they should investigate the Vivint employee!!!!!!!  Also, that employee threw his trash in the street which I had to clean up.  Kind of feel he should find himself in the unemployment line come Monday.  If you REALLY read these and give a da--,  how about having a manager (not a clerk) call me.

One of the big selling points was the main breaker panel \"upgrade\" vivint would complete at a cost of approx. $2k. I advised my sales rep that was great news. I moved up the solar project for my house because it was going to coincide with a new electric vehicle purchase with the solar install, so my EV can be charged by the panels. The wiring for the EV charging station was completed and coiled at the main panel for connection once the new panel was is.  Then the Vivint solar panels and \"upgraded\" main breaker panel were installed. Upon inspection from the city, the panel must now be removed and reinstalled at a different location. Additionally, the \"upgraded\" main breaker panel vivnt will be reinstalling for me will not have the capacity for the EV charging station, which means once vivint is done i will need to again upgrade the brand new freakin panel vivint installed at a costs again out of my for for....yup, $2k.

            "The latest installation of solar equipment has been a poor experience so far. After the installation the county  inspector came out and found some problems. I received confusing communications from Vivent during the next couple of weeks. Some said everything was ready to go and others said I needed to schedule another visit from Vivent. Finally I had the Vivent electrician come out to fix the problem. Then the county inspector needed to come again. When he did, he found it still wasn't right. I talked with someone last Friday and scheduled the Vivent electrician to come out Wednesday to fix it again. Then on Monday I got phone message and an email asking me to call to schedule the Vivent electrician to come out to fix the problem.  I called and explained I had already scheduled that. It seems your company doesn't communicate with one another within the same company. Every time a Vivent  electrician comes out I have to set aside a 3 hour window, which could turn into more time if he comes at the end of the window time. Every time I schedule a county inspection I have to set aside the entire day. Fortunately I am semi-retired, so it is not such a difficulty, but if I were working full time, I would have lost a lot of time at work with all these repairs and inspections. Please try to get your act together. Install it right the first time and improve your inter-office communication. Thank you.",

I was traveling and actually was having difficulty understanding him but I got the gist of the story. Seems like it's been a very long time that the seller units have been on the roof and we have not benefited from the summer sun. I realize that  it will be there for next year. Everyone keeps talking about they want to make sure everything is safe everything is done the way it is supposed to be done but honestly what's taking so long.  When I get home I had a message from the previous day from a gentleman by the name of Chris who honestly spoke so fast if I really  hadn't received this phone call multiple times before I wouldn't of known what he was talking about. Yes I have been kept informed at least every other week receiving the same message from one of the representatives in that messages we need to make sure what we have meets standards.   To receive so many messages and sayThe same thing makes you really wonder is there a problem?",

            "Actually I'm glad you asked that question. Because that's not a fair thing for me to judge wouldn't hire him based on a phone call message. He needs to listen to it and see if he could understand what he was saying. He wanted to get all the information he had to say I to  The person receiving the message. A I don't know if he was reading from a script but he was  actually talking too fast I think someone needs to help him in that rather than hey answer the question would I hire him?   He wasn't rude his goal was to give me the script to the customer I think he just needs  help in leaving leaving messages on the telephone.   I do not believe it was Christopher whoI spoke to on the telephone yesterday but it could've been. That again is not his fault I was traveling I was out in the Midwest and service was poor .",

            "Beginning of the Solar process was pretty smooth, Dallin Benson was particulalry great at keeping me informed and making sure the process went as smooth as possible. Even when little things did go wrong he contacted me, let me know what was happening and got moving on a resolution to whatever problems or outstanding items there happened to be. Everything up through the install of the actual solar panels went pretty well, and off that part of the process, I have no complaints at all. \\\\My issues started post install of the Solar panels. Constantly receiving conflicting information about what the status was of getting everything setup with the utilities company and whether or not I would be getting new meters installed. The estimated 'live' date for my system went by without any real progress being made to even let me know what was going on. Anytime I call in to support to figure out what the next steps are I was answered with 'Well the local Texas team is really busy and should contact you within 5 weeks.' Note that at that point even 2 weeks meant that my payments for the Solar loan would start, and I would begin to pay double my monthly electricity costs since the panels on my house were effectively decorative until I could actually use them.\\\\Only this week has any real progress been made and I have been told that new meters will be installed by my utility company soon, and that after that, we should be able to turn the system on.\\\\All in all I like Vivant Solar, but I think there are some major execution/communication failures that need to be addressed before I would be able to definitively recommend Vivint. Issues like this, before the system is even live make you really question whether or not you picked the right company and second guess yourself for choosing them.\\\\I truly hope that the experience moving forward shows that these issues are being dealt with and that Vivint is an amazing choice for Solar.",

What I am irritated by is the 4 months I've had to wait to be able to benefit from these panels. It is not just Edison twp either it took you a month to prepare and submit the paperwork to them and that's just too long. Without the panels my energy bill is more than it was not less.",

After several attempts to get reasonable production the system either over produced or under produced. This has created a financial ,time and effort DISRUPTION  in our lives that is unacceptable. Caught between the Sourthern California Edison Company and Vivint Solar Company has turned out to be regrettable. Our efforts to resolve this issue started 6 months after the panels were installed. The Vivint Solar Panel Co. representives have been polite and courteous, however, the solution they provided was to disconnect about 6 panels and now they are asking us to sign a new agreement that would authorize the addition of 12 new panels that were installed without our permission or authorization. After 18 months we are waiting for their response to void our contract and remove both the old panels and new  unactivated panels.I entered this contact in good faith with Vivint Solar Co. and now we elect to part company in good faith so we can have get with our normal lives.. I am offering to have this matter solved through arbitration. No HARD FEELINGS . Doing the right thing is always best don't you agree?

It is now October and still has not been turned on.  All i recieve are emails and emails explaining the reason (excuses) as to why.  From it was a clreical error on our part, to the city is back logged, to another clerical error, PG&E has not signed off on paperwork.  My neighbor had solar installed three weeks after I did with Vivint and he has been up and running as of three weeks ago.  So he is six weeks ahead of me.  Why does Vivint's mistakes have to cost me money?  I could have gone with a dozen other solar companies and i would be up and running months ago.  All Vivint is doing is costing me money on my PG&E bill.  My NEMS is up over $1,000 dollars.

She asked me to wait while she triex to figure out what went wrong. I faxed evetything again plus the fax history oage. Within five minutes she called and said she was making sure the proper dept received this info. She said they might hear from Edidon in a few days. I also texted Jacob Contreras the sales person and he said he'd get right on it and he did.i have great respect for Jacob and Donalynn.\\\\You need to better train your staff on folluwing up and following through.

I felt ignored and not looked at as a client, every single worker that came was rude, no one would make a report about my concerns, even my complaints were ignored, every worker kept blaming someone else there for my problem still hasnt been solved, defenetely will not recomend to anyone.",

A single point of contact who understands the customer, install and process who is on top of what is needed to get done and when. I have been going through my sales rep (Thiago) who has been great but clearly is not the correct person to be addressing issues like permits, town approvals and National Grid. Your customer service is really useless. All they do is read comments in my account file but really can't answer basic questions like what is the status of my design approval. \\\\All in all, I feel it took way too long for this install to occur and a month later I'm still waiting for the system to be turned on. If this had all happened when it was supposed to I would have been able to take advantage of some long summer days right from the start. Now I will be luck to have the system active by November.",

            "You put panels on our roof without doing a full inspection. You said we wouldn't need a new roof within the next twenty years, so you didn't give us the $500 that would \"completely cover the cost of panel removal and reinstallation\" (per your sales rep). Our roof lacks ventilation, had your inspector checked the attic it would have been clear that we need a new roof. We are now trying to get the panels off so we can get a new roof, per our contract with you we must maintain the roof. So here we are, trying to maintain our roof and you are giving us the run around and telling us it will be thousands of dollars to remove the panels because they haven't been on for five years and generating energy. So tell me something- does your sales rep's flagrant misrepresentation of the cost of removal & reinstallation break our contract? Or does your companies efforts to prohibit us from fixing our roof break the contract? Will the contract be broken when the weight of your solar panels collapses our roof? I wouldn't recommend your company to my worst enemy, let alone the people I care about. In fact, when people ask me about your company I will make sure to convey my experience with your company in full detail (from the lack of communication to the lies to the out right disrespect from some of your representatives). You may have suckered us into a 20year contract, but I'll be damned if I let you get anyone else I know. Shame on you Vivint.",

            "there is no consistency in what I am told by each person that I talk with.  I have been trying to get my solar panel system up and working for me but everything that could go wrong has...  my panels were installed in February 2017 and here it is October 2017 and I still can't use my solar panels... if anyone asks me if vivint solar is a company to go with... I would absoluting not... after the panels were installed the paperwork was sent in to be approved and as the months went by I kept being told to just wait it sometimes take longer to be approved... I kept asking for someone to check with the city to see what the problem was and nobody did anything until mid May and they found the city did not have the paperwork.. I believe vivint dropped the ball here.. I don't think the paperwork was submitted but if it was and the city lost it vivint should have checked sooner find out what the problem was and not just tell me to wait.  The city said there was a problem with the paperwork so vivint had to make some changes and resubmit.  Then the weeks went by with no answers.  Then in July I heard that the paperwork had been accepted..  the final inspection by the city was scheduled... no show....the city guy took the day off.  So a week later it was rescheduled... but then I heard that the city lost the approved paperwork so vivint had to resubmit the paperwork again.  After a few weeks the work was finally passed inspection after a vivint person spent several hours on the roof fixing some problems.  Then surprise just a week later a person from Rocky Mtn power came out and replaced the meter... I asked him if I could finally turn on the system.. He said sure no problem.  I then turned to you customer service group to find out how to tell if the solar panel system was working...  they came unglued and told me I had to turn if off immediately because they had not received a PTO.  I blew up .. told her what I thought of vivint solar.  I then called Scott Rawlings.. he has been the only person there that has shown any compassion with how long this whole process is taking... well here I sit with out a system working... a person cant be found to come here and find out why the system isn't reporting anything until October 31st or early November... and I am still waiting on a PTO.  If I could I would have you guys come take this system off my roof and put it back the way it was... cancel everything with the bank and let me go to another company that might work a bit better with their customers.  Also I was told by the salesman that if for some reason it took longer than a few months to have the system working I would receive compensation from vivint for the Mosiac payments..  I am still waiting on four months worth of Mosiac payments.",

Especially for those citizens that arent a fan of having them plastered on their homes to begin with. With the lengthy activation times, we have to look at our homes everyday with these panels, some covering brand new roofs, and not benefit a single dollar for 3 months or more. Then wait another 3 months or more to even see a difference on energy!!",

The amount that I am paying between vivint and BGE is the same before you installed your system.  Also you installed 32 panels on y garage and I was told by your sales and operations managers that My garage would be on WiFi and now you are telling me that a tren has to be duty at my exspence. Which is unacceptable.  If so I want your complete system to be removed from my property and repair my roofs on my house and my garage.   I was missed sold with your system by the sale person and your staff.  If this system doesn't show me and good results other matters will occur.  Please have someone in person to\\Talk to me face to face.

Also, I was told by Vivint that the reason it would take so long is due to slow inspections/approvals by both the city and utilities. However, the city inspected (and approved) the system within a week of the install. And, as of my last update, the utility has still not received the paperwork from Vivint.

Have had multiple calls over the last few months stating that the plans have been submitted to the City for the permit.  How many times do they have to be submitted?  Have there been issues and corrections needed?  I don't know.  All that being said, everyone I have worked with at Vivint or the subs have been great.  All problems seem to be in house communication problems.  I understood three years ago when we first started to work with Vivint that there are bugs to work out with such a fast growing company, but three years later and things have not improved at all.

The problems ae the sources of information. it appears there are many roadblocks in the system, so it is very hard to get timely information  or information that is pertinent. It is usually generic, useless information. This is the 4th survey I have filled out, and in each prior case I have made some strong comments regarding deficiencies in the processes. I have never had any responses to my comments. In each of the prior surveys I was asked if I wanted to have someone contact me. In all 3 cases I said yes,  please contact me. However, I have never been contacted. It appears the customer surveys are a phoney charade with no real corporate interest in the customer responses, and even worse, no interest in learning how to serve the customer better.",

Second, because of the education i got about after committing to vivint I immediately called my brother (Mark) and I explained it to him easy to say i referred him to vivint and i got to buy it. Having said all that, my system got installed. Two weeks later my brothers got installed. But only to find out, his is already fully operational and my system isn\u2019t and counting!!! Isn\u2019t that a shit?!! Long story short, I\u2019m a very frustrated customer regreting my decisions with Vivint!!! Lastly, customer success/ customer service weren\u2019t helping. They gave me the fucking run-around when I needed help calling them over the phone numerous times!! This was a stressful experience!",

            "I was approached by you, about increasing the number of solar panels.  After signing the contract 2+ weeks went by before they were installed, on September 25th.  It is now October 25th.  The day after they were installed I got a letter that it will take 8-21 WEEKS to get the approvals. This was never told to me before.  The new solar panels that I received are not matching the once that were installed last year.  So if I sell my house, I have to explain why they are different.  What is the difference between the panels?  It looks like me you are buying cheaper panels from China.  There is no reason that it should take this long to be approved.  The initial panels were approved within a week.  I will continue to discuss with my friends, about what you put your customers thru.  It is terrible customer service. and I won't  reccomend  you to anyone, unless I can turn on my power by the 2nd. week in November.  It is laziness on your part, especially since this is now your slow season. Work should be done ASAP on my house.  If it is not done, then I have no other choice, but to tell all my friends and business partners, that you do not treat your customers as your highest priority, you treat them like a number. You will go out of  business, if this continues to be your business plan.  I live in a small town.  Also, with what you are doing why are you advertising for new sales reps in my home town, claiming they can make upto $116,000 their first year.  It is all about the money for you and the hundreds of people that have to review the plans.  Also, after a year I supposedly received more efficeint panels.  Will you give me upgraded panels when they are more efficient in 3 years. write me back with your response.",

I called your customer service on Saturday, and they are absolutely useless.  they looked at my  account but could not answer any question, they could only to wait until Monday to call super service people. POT is not an answer.  I have dealt with 3 different special reps.  You are either lazy, or you want your rebate check back first before you let me turn my system on.  This is wrong, and shows your lack of any type of customer service.  I am taking the 2 different panel numbers, to other solar companies tomorrow, and let them tell me if you are helping me, or going cheap on me.  Customer Service says that Chinese panels are infiriore to American made panels.  You will be hearing me soon.  Mike",

If the company is unable to meet the 11/10/17 timeframe they quoted as being the latest, I will be hiring a lawyer to take care of vivint paying for all removal and costs, so I can move forward with a competent company.

I was told by my Sales Rep that he would ensure that I would change to the correct rate plan before the system got turned on. APS changed their rate plan so as to have demand charges on the old plan design (which I had). Obviously solar does not work well with these demand charges. It seems to me that Vivint was more interested in the sale than calling all their customers to make sure that the customer had the correct rate plan with the utility company.",

I am told my everyone who calls and this is at least two phone calls by two different people every two weeks that for the longest time we were in the 40 days and the paperwork was being reviewed before it is sent to t he next step.

So I took a vacation day because my time schedule was between 2 and 5. 2:00 came and went, 2:30 came and went .  I called several times to find out where this technician was was he coming. Finally get a phone call from customer service to tell me that the technician was not going to be there that I had to reset up another appointment. Needless to say I was livid as I wasted the vacation day waiting for your personnel. 5 pm I get a phone call from the technician apologizing saying he didn't have the part to install and he could not find it. How do you make an appointment for an installation 3 to 4 weeks in advance and not have the part? Why was I not called at 2?",

            "Hi Claudia,\\As we spoke today I am very unsatisfied of the solar process with Vivint. \\1. I was told to be at home for the final inspection, so I took a day off in order to be home. \\2. I waited until 3:30 and no one showed up or ring the bell or called me. The window\\was from 10:00 to 2:00.\\3. I called vivint and they told me that the inspection passed. \\4. Then you told me that I need to call JCPL and arrange an inspection with them. \\Conclusion: I took a day off from work for absolutely nothing because no one was able to let me know that there was someone in my property inspecting the installation. Then I have to call JCPL to make another inspection when I was told that everything was going to be taking care by you.  I am very disappointed because I even wanted to talk to a supervisor and no one was able to get that for me. After all these, the last storm we had I found out that I have a leak. So imagine how I\u2019m feeling about Vivint. Moreover, I am thinking very seriously to take those panels out of my roof. \\\\Thank you. \\\\Sent from my iPhone\\\\On Oct 31, 2017, at 5:05 PM, Vivint Solar Customer Success &lt;CustomerSuccess@vivintsolar.com&gt; wrote:\\\\Hi Jorge,\\\\This is Claudia from the Vivint Solar Customer Success Management team.

Now we have to have the panels removed for replacement of our roof due to hail damage and it will cost us $2200.  \\\\Not what we signed up for when we started.  Our insurance is going to cover $1800.  We need you to comply with insurance since these panels should not cost us anything per our understanding when the process began.  You have gone through a lot with PNM to make this happen and now we are finding it is going to be yet another amount of time (not sure how much) for anything to happen.  Not happy at all and would not recommend to anyone else as we do not have a good feeling about any part of it.

Something was omitted on the initial install (a grounding screw) and yesterday Vivant came out to install it. At 6 PM, I got a call from my tenant saying she has no power and the neighbors do. I suspected that Vivant had shutoff the house power during their work for safety reasons and called customer service to have someone come out and fix the problem. It took a while but someone called me back and said that there was no reason for vivant to touch that shutoff with what they had to do and wanted to know if I could check the shutoff myself. On my way there, the yenant called me back and NG had arrived and found their power shutoff. So problem was created by Vivant and fixed by NG and still no power generated.",

Now I have been informed that it still may be a month or more before I can activate them. I was not initially told that it might be 3 months or more before I could utilize the panels for electricity. I was told it would be at least a month or so before all the approvals would be received. I was fine with that at the time. I also reported after the panels were installed that 2 panels needed to be adjusted, as they did not align with the adjacent panels. This was reported on a questionaire I received on my Email, and also on a phone call I received from Vivent. I also mentioned that one of the two panels had a scratch on it. I was told that the scratch may not hinder the functioning of the panel. No one has come to adjust the panels yet. This is why I gave you an 8.",

It\u2019s November and the end is nowhere in sight. We\u2019re being told by one representative that the hold-up is PG&E, while another rep says a part is broken on our system. This broken part was discovered on October 11 and we were told they\u2019d be back in one week to replace it. On November 7, they called to tell my husband the next available appointment is on December 1. When I called customer service to inquire about this, she said there is no record of a broken part. I am so dissatisfied and fed up with this company. All I get are lies and excuses. I will not only NOT recommend Vivint, but I\u2019ll actively tell people to avoid your shady business practices.

When I previously addressed my concerns about having my power disconnected for several hours without any notification, Vivint explained that it is not there problem because it was a sub-contractor (HIRED AND ASSIGNED BY VIVENT). This is completely unsatisfactory and I will not be continuing with the installation. When I spoke with the manager, Nathan, yesterday, his only resolution to the problems I have been having was to \"promise\" this wouldn't happen again and insisted that the fastest way to resolve my concerns were by continuing the process. Clearly the only concern of the entire team is \"the sale\". The fact that I've lost several work hours trying to accommodate this installation was treated with little regard.",

            "I got a call from a gal at vivant yesterday 11/9/17 and she stated that they would be contacting us soon to complete the final inspection. I told her that a guy from vivant was here now. She was very surprised and since this was an ad on she checked to see if it was someone from the original panels but said no that she did not show anyone to be coming out today. The guy who was here was very rude and to make a long story short... He never called to say he was  coming- just showed up, had an attitude, worked on our modem and left here with our network not working. We run our business out of here and are now not able to scan or print. Very upset!! I have made calls and have not been able to talk to anyone that can help me at vivant.",

Since we are retired and we use more lights and also have the furnace on more and higher than we did just a couple of years ago.  I signed that form.

The technician never showed up and no one contacted me to let me know that they weren\u2019t coming today. I am police officer and I worked until 6am today, I stayed up until 11am waiting for the technician. I would not recommend this company to anyone. I have had friends that had solar panels put up after me and their systems have been online for months. Unacceptable!",

I believe the initial panel count was insufficient, thereby, a new contract was needed with higher vivint rates.  The sales person received extra sales through this process.  It has been 6 months and the panels have yet to be functioning.  Additionally, I have asked Vivint to contact my tenants directly when the system is down, for whatever reason, and that has not ever been accomplished.  Instead, I have been the liaison between vivint and my two tenants. Finally, the request for a recent utility bill from my tenants were submitted, followed by more requests which were followed by more submissions.  So very frustrating!

Now my inverter  has been downgraded to reduce the power rather than just removing some panels to get me under the 10Kw.  I'm not sure why I have to pay for a less efficient system.  I would never recommend Vivant Solar to anyone!!",

We have had a very unpleasant experience with Vivint and I would never recommend anyone do business with them on a solar level.  You didn't follow the proper protocol when installing, which resulted in a denied permit, you then sat on our permit and did not submit it to the city for approval for over 2 months and tried to blame it on the city which we know is not true because we know the city inspector.  Not only was my solar not up and running when it was supposed to be but then that resulted in me paying both the power company and Mosaic when I didn't even have solar up and running yet.  So I paid Mosaic for 4 months before my solar was up and running.  You then told us if that happened that Vivint personally would refund my money since I was paying double power bills in a sense.  We contacted Vivint on a daily basis trying to get our refunds only to find out that because you dragged your asses that you won't refund us the other 2 months we paid and you want us to pay the taxes on that amount.  That's some great customer service right there.  I have spent more time arguing and fighting with Vivint only to get empty promise after empty promise and no where with each and every phone call.

The 2+ hours he was in my home, I was very clear.  He understood. He said multiple times, all my heating needs would be covered by solar.   After I had the county sign off the the panels,  contacted an HVAC company to make sure the solar would cover my heating needs, I was told no. Not with my current system.  In order for me to use solar instead of propane, I must replace my furnace with an electric system.  I contact customer service to ask for assistance with the $7500.  Anna M is the supervisor I've been speaking with.  She said \"it's a home improvement issue\" and I would not get any help.  I explained in not a home improvement.  I will not be able to use the solar system instead of propane to heat my home.  That is the only reason I wanted solar in the first place.  Anna left me a message today stating my request had been denied.  She is supposed to call me tomorrow morning.  If I can not get cash assistance, perhaps my loan can be reduced?? I have no need for solar if I can not get off propane.  I will see how the conversation goes tomorrow.  Mindi Matsumoto 760-409-9856.",

After our panels were installed and we were handed over to our lead inspection tech, communication has been a MAJOR problem.  I have contacted support many times trying to figure out what was going on.  One person would tell me one thing and another person would call me back and tell me the opposite.  Like no one really knew the answer.  I have left messages for my lead inspection tech and he never has returned any of my phone calls.  I had to follow up many times on my own to get status updates.  Overall I am happy with the panels at this point and I would highly recommend Justin but I am so very disappointed in the way our account was handled after install.  I am not sure I would recommend Vivint for that one reason alone.  Communication is so important!",

The electrican neglected to mark the new electrical box, told me he would call to make an appointment to mark the box. Never call for that appointment, meaning he lied to me. Our town electrical inspector came to the house and rejected the installation, no markings in the box and not outside grounding wire. It's going to be Dec. 26th before the installation is completed.  Your no making money off my installation.  Sales person sold the job and never contact me to follow-up, not a good impression.",

I have tried to reach my rep. with no answer.  The day the panels were installed he (my rep. Robert Wyssling) said he would return later in the day. HE NEVER RETURNED AND TO DATE,AFTER LEAVING SEVERAL MESSAGES ON HIS CELLPHONE  I AM STILL WAITING  FOR A RETURN CALL. Also, yesterday, Alexis left the message regarding the photographs that were taken on 11/30. I spoke with the technician that was here and her assured me that those photographs had been sent.

            "still waiting for service to be up and running, got a call a few weeks ago regarding an issue with electrical panel that needed to be fixed, first available was today Dec 8th, never a phone call or an email confirming, numerous phone call during the last few weeks to get system inspected by City of Lowell. Why would you inspect a system that had an issue with grounding?? Call district manager,  went to voice mail, waiting for return call.  If they don't come today and get this resolved I will request that panels be removed. You do not have a great track record so far AGAIN. One of your employees was here last week to read my meter, said system was out of date. Requested the chip when District manager Nick Howard was here over two months ago, still not done. Asked your meter reader to please do a follow up, nothing, no email or call. Had lots of problems with the last system you installed on my house. The installers were great, it's your follow up that is way below par. WILL NOT RECOMMEND YOUR COMPANY AND A FEW PEOPLE HAVE ASKED",

Too many of your representatives have gotten into this claiming that they will send a damn report...well I hear nothing back. I have asked for these charges to be taken care of and all I get is silence. I would appreciate it if just one (1) rep will follow through with my complaint from beginning to the end!!!

Lost 5 months of good sun longer days to built up credit .Now with winter months less sun snow on panels I will have to pay 3 bills.Your installation will kick in on final hook up from PSE&G then I will pay their gas portion and with no credit from solar probably pay PSE&G electric .\\Don't understand how you guys stay in business with all your layout money for the installation & equipment.Last I really at the beginning didn't understand that it may not help in the sale of the house .Especially since the next owner will incur the costs of the installation for the nex t what ever years.,",

A simple phone call should have been in order. She said email can take 24 hours to reach its destination. If it is known that it takes that long then a phone call should have been used.

I keep filling out  these surveys but nothing seems to be happening. They did call and schedule an appointment for today to come fix the problem - three months later - but then no ever showed. I would like someone to contact me or my wife about getting a crew to come out and remove the panels all together and fix the holes in the roof. Solar sounded like a great idea, but frankly we are past it now, and ready for the headache to end.

            "I have been spoken to multiple Customer Success Managers over the last few months after the installation and it has been a very frustrating experience. Few have provided somewhat a status update and follow-ups (Raphael, Nick, Ana) but no progress and mostly I got that I check back in 24-48 hours.  The Installation was completed back in Sept. and I was promised that the system will be operational in 1 or 2 months but there was a very long delay in getting the city inspection. Finally, the inspection was scheduled and after my hand holding the process with multiple follow-ups calls and talking directly to local inspection lead. The City Inspection was passed on December 6th and as of today, your interconnection team has not even submitted an application to the utility company. When we spoke to the utility company even they were surprised that they have no knowledge of any solar system being installed at my resident and they usually get notification from the contractor at least a month ahead. I was promised a Feb Tax Credit for the year of 2017 by your sales team otherwise I would not have installed the system at this year. I was asked to sign multiple documents in last few days for Net Metering which may not be necessary according to the utility company and I was told Net Metering documents were the reason for the hold and that was a complete lie because of insufficiency of your interconnection team. It has been very disappointing at the least and I have wasted many hours of my valuable time without any progress, benefit, and compensation.",

I'm doing it primarily to take advantage of our governments stupidity.  With all the junk on my roof the maximum power out of it is a max of 40 amps.  That is pathetic.  My service to my home is a 200 amp circuit which I use quite readily.  the annual average that you show  for my home by passes my seasonal fluctuation, high in the summer and moderately low in the winter.  In the summer it is woefully underpowered, Which means I could never be off the grid.  The end results is that everyone power is going to be more expensive.  That is economics 101.  The CO2 argument is a joke along with the carbon footprint.  It doesn't matter what we do when the countries of India and China are bringing on line at least one coal fired electric plant each month and will continue to do so until 2030.  What this means is that we will  become lest competitive in the years to come because we pay more for energy here and they pay less for energy there.  The economy of the  last 200 years is based upon cheap, reliable energy, ever since we changed from human and animal power to chemical energy.  Our society is base upon that fundamental reality.  We could not support a 300 million plus society based on human and animal power.  Thanks for listening",

            "I'm very unhappy with Vivint. We had an extra set of panels installed in April 2017, and we are still waiting for them to to be functional. We have had upgrade after upgrade, inspection after inspection, and photos have been taken at least 5-6 times. We have had numerous calls from Vivnt reps nearly always informing us that \"just one more thing needs to be done,\" and yet hear we sit nine months later without the use of our additional set of panels. The local sales manager has also promised to intervene, and he hasn't. We want to put our home on the market, but can't because our solar is in limbo. THIS HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE, AND I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND VIVINT TO ANYONE!!!!",

Classic case of the \u201cleft hand doesn\u2019t know what the right hand is doing.\u201d  There seems to be no coordination at all.  I had panels removed from our roof last May, to fix leaks caused by Vivint installers.  The repairs were done, and months have passed since I was told that a special re-installation crew would be assigned to put the panels back in place.  During that time, a Vivint rep came by to enquirer as to why the router was not communicating with Vivint.  I told him it\u2019s been down since May.  I keep getting calls telling me that the reinstall will be scheduled soon, but it never happens.  I put very little faith in anything that Vivint tells me.  It amazes me that, with the system off, and Vivint not receiving payment from me, as a Client in almost a year, that it would draw someone\u2019s attention, as to why Vivint is not receiving payment from a client for so long.   I\u2019m thinking that somehow, somewhere, someone is going to get the panels up and working again.",

I asked if they could simply check on your end to see if you were getting power. She asked me to call back again Monday. More of my time wasted..so I requested Vincent call or E mail me and they said they don\u2019t do that. It has been a never ending waste of my time and we only signed up because of the great service from Erick Thomas, who has now left your company. I think I can guess why, based upon our experience. Often time thoughout the months of waiting for solar service my wife wanted to cancel the order and I talked her out of it.",

The install occurred a couple of months later.   Then we were told we needed to keep waiting for some sort of review.  \\At the end of November I received an email with copies of the documents sent to PGE.  And I have waited.  \\On the day that this contact with \"Customer Success ?\" was made...I told your person that PGE told me that Vivant had not made the $140 application payment.  Your rep insisted that you are merely waiting for the approval of PGE.  \\PG&E advised me of the exact date and time they submitted the invoice (now over a month ago).  I emailed that information to \"Customer Success\" but of course there was no reply.  The rep who I spoke to said he would check - and \"get back to me in a few days\".

You guys said to call Mosaic & explain to them & they should credit us for the payments..until we get our panels turned on & nope..wrong again! They said they gave you guys long enough (90 days from the purchase of the panels) and the issue is with you guys (Vivint). So FYI I wanted to give a 1 on this survey buy the only reason I\u2019m giving it a 7 is because the last customer service rep was very helpful & resent me the ducument that needed to be signed [AGAIN] (even tho this was the 4th time sending it to guys) & that finally pushed things along (hopefully). So we\u2019ll see what happens next..probably nothing!",

It was installed Oct 4 2017 it is now passed your 4 to 13 weeks you promised to have it turned on. Now our first payment is coming up and we have an Edison bill and a solar payment coming up,  due to your company not passing inspections. Your representative gave us false information that Mosaic would push our payment and there representative informed us they don't do that and Vivint will pay your first payments if it's do to them. She then transferred us back to a Vivint representative named Ben you proceeded to deny that they would do that and was no help until we got very upset that he was unwilling to help us out one bit. Then finally agreed to send an email to get it approved when he should have done that to begin with. I still have no response, and if we have to pay our Edison bill and solar payment you will not get any recommendations from us and we will be cancelling our Vivint security system.

The final papers were sent to SCE but the photos were no good so SCE is waiting for new photos.  Personally, I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt that we will eventually have solar but the others living here don't really have anything nice to say about the process, and if it's not going to happen, just take the panels off.  When asked, they generally say, still waiting, don't expect it to happen any time soon, and they they may want to rethink about getting solar.",

When I spoke to my electric company on 1/29/18, I was told they still had not received the document(s) from Vivint.  In addition Vivint continues to tell me that the electric company still had to install a solar meter at my house, but as I keep telling Vivint the electric company had installed the solar meter BEFORE 12/5/17 when an electrician from Vivint upgraded my electrical box.  The electric company confirmed that for me yesterday.  All inspections were done 12/6/17.  Since then Vivint or somebody has been spinning its wheels while I am approaching two months since the last technical work by either Vivint or the electric company was completed (on 12/8/17).  I had nothing but high praise for the technical personnel from Vivint who very ably worked to install the system (and told me that the meter at my house was indeed a solar meter).  But, I have experienced nothing but frustration since we got to the point of trying to send documents to the electrical company.  Hence, the low rating this time.",

I contacted Vivint in June of 2016 to get more panels and just had them installed in January 2018. I called to complain that I got an email saying that my service will take up to 18 weeks  more to get them activate and I got Misty who was so uncaring that I asked for her supervisor and was told that the soonest I could speak to one would be 48 hours later. No company I have every dealt with has been so unresponsive and lacting in customer service skills. So how are  you doing in customer service? Worst I have every dealt with.

However, my husband had call customer service to inquire about the inspection updates and when someone will be coming out to check on it. He was missed informed twice! It is so frustrating that no one can give us a straight answer. We been having someone giving us the go around and it really shouldn't be how a business should run. We regret to go with Vivint and will be retracting all of our recommendations. Installation was great but the follow through is awful. Each day that goes by an additional day of our money going to waste; it is very disappointing. How are we being compensated?",

            "It's honestly difficult to know where to start. I'll be as brief as possible. Approx 3 years ago Vivint installed solar panels on my home. Due to reasons unbeknownst to me, poor communication among your team I suppose, the install team \"didn't know\" we had open beam ceiling and the installation crew drilled 18 holes thru my ceiling. Yep! 18 screws came right through my open beam ceiling! It took two different dates to complete the install due to this error. Both times, holes were drilled in my open beam ceiling. No surprise the roof leaked that winter. A Vivint rep came out with some wet-patch which stopped the leak temporarily. However, the roof leaked again the following winter in the same spot (one of the areas they had drilled thru my ceiling). Upon inspection by a roofing company of your choice my roof was deemed \"damaged beyond repair\" and needed to be replaced. Roofer stated the panels never should have been installed on a roof of it's age in the first place. Vivint did, after MANY months of back and forth replace the portion of roof with panels. We had to pay for the other portion of the roof without panels at the tune of $16,000 out of our own pocket. The process for re-roofing and reinstallation of the original system was a complete nightmare when it came to coordinating with Vivint. Vivint's left hand not knowing what the right hand was doing. Throughout all of these processes I had to take time off of work, using my vacation days to facilitate to be sure things were coordinated properly. Prior to the leaking roof issue, we bought an electric car. After all, we had solar on our home! This of course had us using more power and needing more panels. June of 2017 we (foolishly) had Vivint install additional panels to meet our needs. THE PANELS STILL ARE NOT FUNCTIONAL.  I'll let you spend the time researching the variety of \"reasons\" why this newest system still isn't functioning. There are of course a lot more details of issues, challenges and my time wasted throughout all of the ordeals. I simply do not have the time or desire to go any further into detail than I have here. I can tell you though that I've spent countless hours on the phone with your company throughout all of this. So there you go. There's my feedback.",

            "Scott Rawlings Is doing a great job for me at this point . I have no issues with him so far. My problems stem from the salesman Landon. He was knowledgeable, persistent in a nice way but,some of the things he said weren't quite correct and he should of had a lot better communication.  Since I was a big energy user according to Landon ,I needed 37 panels to cover my needs. Then it went to 35. But there is only 31 panels on the roof. No one said anything to me. I'm thinking I'm working with  a #1 rated company. Why didn't someone tell  me why there are only 31 panels now. The idea is to get the most panels I can right? Use the sun! Landon and others from your office  sure can call me to get inspections and paperwork signed ASAP  (need it now, go go go) because of timing to get it thru the APU. So here I am , with 31 panels. All someone had to do is inform me of whats going on and why. Not learn the hard way.  Also Landon  told me in the beginning if I wasn't producing enough energy, more panels could be added. Scott said maybe not. It's  hard to do and might not be even possible  because of getting it approved by APU.  I told Landon that the Meter Spot Report said the tree in back needs to be trimmed . He said I miss read the report. The APU came out the other day to inspect and said the wires and branches are touching, the  tree need to be trimmed. No approval. Scott said he doesn't have any blue prints of my install yet, I have panels on the roof. How does that work? So I don't know what to think. I still have a hole in the inside of my back bedroom from the electrical panel install. So I don't really have much if any trust  at this point. It's like selling you a spots car with 500hp, signing you up, then you find out later it's only 400hp. I don't think you would trust me anymore no matter what I tell you. Anyway Scott is trying to rebuild my trust. We will see where it goes from here. Thanks for listening.",

I was told that you had a good relationship with PG&E. I have gotten calls from you every day that you can\u2019t get ahold of PG&E and the paperwork you said you sent to them in November 2017. It is way passed the day that it would be able for me to turn on my new system. I am now working with my attorney to charge you for the energy savings that I should have saved from 9/25/2017. Plus damages for your failure to get my system started. I am now seeking legal advise to remove the entire system, and return my roof to normal. I have a 50 year warranty on my roof.  You will need to remove my entire system, since you went way past the contract that we both signed. You have neglected your part of the contract. I now ask you to remove the entire system, and return my home to whole. Contract law was abused by you. I lived up to the contract, but you have failed on your half. Please contact me, when you will be here to remove my non-working systems, and fix my roof back to where it was before I ever talked to anyone from Vivint Solar. Mike Jarrett",

The simple fact is that after installation each further step required multiple contacts initiated by us. Not impressed with your service people's ability to accurately outline the process. You should assign each customer one account person to check on the status of each installation about once a week to see see if the promised timetable is likely to progress and to un-stick administrative delays that hang fire until the promised time line has elapsed.",

It\u2019s been almost 2 months since the installation and the service still hasn\u2019t been turned on. I received a voice mail a couple of days ago that said it would still be another 3-6 weeks before they could turn the panels on. In the mean time mosaic has already started charging me my monthly fee for the panels. I\u2019m still waiting the paperwork so I can claim the solar on my taxes. And I\u2019m waiting on a check for 1500 that I should have gotten by 45 days after installation which has passed. That check was for a previous inconvenience that  occurred when the first person I was working with quit the company in the middle of setting everything up. I\u2019m truly hoping that once everything starts to be operational, I\u2019m satisfied with the service it to be honest I\u2019m a bit disappointed overeat this point.",

You should be able to make better estimations than that!\\\\The other problem is that, though you have a tracker on the website and app (I was never informed about the app, by the way) there were many steps that were never checked even though steps further down the line started being checked.

This process took way too long, and it sat in corporates review box since Dec 14th when they knew the plan changed.\\Other than that delay, I was very happy with my salesman, the the panel placers were great.  I am hoping the panels work great and all will be well.",

            "I believe we were delayed in getting our system up and running due to someone not following through on the placard to be placed on the utility box.  It doesn't take 3 months to order it and have it taken care of!  And the office tried to tell me they were trying to work around the city.   When I called the city, they had not been contacted.  They were the ones who told me that the paperwork was on hold, waiting for the placard.  So I was lied to and I don't appreciate that.  It was very unprofessional.  Also, we paid for 2 months of electric bills that were not necessary because your company dropped the ball on following through with what was needed to complete the permit.   It only took 2 weeks from the time I called and complained until the permit was approved.  And the city part only took 1 day!   So you can see that I am very disappointed in your company at this present time.  We are still waiting for the approval from the utility company and I really hope that you're not still wasting time working with them to get their approval.  \\Since we begin paying for the solar panels on March 8, I would really like to be able to use the them by then.  We just had to pay another $128 on our utility bill today!  That we should not have had to pay.  \\I do have to say that when Daniel came out to put on the placards, he said the City Inspector couldn't come out that day.  When I told him how disappointed I was with your company already, he somehow convinced the inspector to come do the inspection later that morning.  (Or did he lie to me the first time because he didn't want to stick around for 2 hours to wait for the inspector?)  I am not sure anymore, but your customer service reps seem to be a bit dishonest with me when I call.   Not all, but some.  Very disappointed!   I will not be recommending your company to my friends at this point, unless you can find some way to compensate me for the loss of time and frustration.   Do you put everyone off for the maximum amount of time!  Or did we just fall through some crack?",

            "First our sales person, Joshua, has been amazing and very helpful. However, when the solar panels were installed everything was fine for the first 24-36 hours. After this we started hearing pigeons on the roof. We called and after about 5 weeks a third party came out and installed the guards on the panels. I had asked for pictures and the third party told me they would send them to Vivint and I could get the pictures from Vivint. What I didn't know until about a week or two later is that the third party that, supposedly, installed the guards did a very poor job and did not install the guards on the bottom of the panels.  Well, it's been about 6-7 weeks now and we have had a nest where three, that we have seen and photographed, pigeons have been born. we are not very happy about this in particular because our son has asthma and sleeps near where they have chosen to nest. We have since locked all the boxes so no one can add the power meter and no one can turn on the panels to produce power for our house. However the lock will be removed ONLY when the new third party installs correctly the pigeon guard as complete as possible leaving no residue on our roof from the nest and the pigeons have left. I have asked the third party to provide pictures and proof of installation of the guards to us.   We have accepted a date for the third party to come and inspect the roof on the 8th of March so they can remove the nest and pigeons and do the install. I hope this will be the end of our issues with pigeons. On that note, I have referred three other homes for solar and alarms for your company.",

When the Vivint inspector completed her work she told me if after six weeks PG&E hasn't come by to turn the system on.  PG&E did not show up and I turned the system on.  A few days later I got a call from Vivint telling me that PG&E had been notified, but to turn the system off as it was not authorized, which I did.  Last week I received a notice from Vivint telling me that they had just completed contact with PG&E.  Eight weeks after the Vivint inspection and ten weeks after the system was installed.  I was told it could be an additional eight plus weeks before PG&E o.k's our system.  That will make it some time in May or later.  This is unacceptable service.  Why did it take more that ten weeks for Vivint to contact PG&E?  I placed a call to my representative Brian Rossiter, who has not had the courtesy to return my call.  The attitude of the representative I spoke with at Vivint Customer Service was one of \"so what, we told you it would take a while for approval.\"  I wasn't told it would take more than three months for you to notify PG&E of the installation.  Yeah, so what.",

            "It's probably NOT a disappointment in Vivint; probably more with PG&E in California....Short story is our original system was under powered due to the fact that we had to base size of system on past 2 years usage when we hadn't been running the AC for the past 3 years because of cost. We wanted solar so that we could hopefully start running the AC again. Well, like I said, the system was not enough to really offset the cost and we ended up with a $1000 true up bill last August/September; not a nice surprise. So, I immediately contacted Vivint and had a secondary system designed and installed. We've been waiting months, seriously months, and we still have not been given the green light to turn it on. I am starting to worry that, if we don't get it turned on soon, we will have another $1000 true up bill at the end of the coming summer. I am not too happy about that prospect.",

Very frustrating to say. It just seem there was no sence of urgency.

I received an email from my local energy company, (and Vivint did as well), on 3/13 that my inspection failed, and that the REC clips had to be replaced.  I called corporate relations and spoke to Jordan, who said someone would contact me the next day to schedule the replacement.  No one did.

No one seemed to have an answer about them.  Lucas said they would  reach out to othe department who should know, and call me back today, (3/16). When no one called me, I called in, and spoke to DonnaLynn.  She saw Lucas' notes, and tried to obtain an answer.

I don\u2019t know if that is true, however. Regardless, we\u2019ve been waiting a year for our extra panels to be installed and functioning. They are just sitting up there taking up space.

Apparently the city did not approve the installed design (need to update electrical hardware?) and I wasn't contacted to schedule the next steps to move us closer to PTO.  We started this process in Nov. 2017 and I was assured that we'd have no problem meeting the April 1st deadline to receive the full MA state SREC solar credits.  Now we'll almost certainly not make the deadline for the state credits and our system won't be active for quite some time after the install.  It seems like we got a lot of help and attention up front, but that Vivint hasn't been very attentive to our needs once the contract was signed and the panels were installed.",

I called, and someone\\came to pick up the ladder without calling me.\\Another week go by, City inspector came.  I saw some paperworks in plastic bag was left\\between the wall and a pipe.  Las Vegas is windy city, and I saw a sheet of paper flying in\\the yard.  I caught it, but I know there more papers.  So, I contacted telling your company\\that there are not necessary papers.",

I still have not been given the ok to start up.  I have a roof leak.  Reported 3 weeks ago.  Damage assessment no showed on an appointment that I waited THREE hours for.  I have had to track down the scheduler (Enoch) to try and get a new appointment scheduled.  This is EXTREMELY disappointing to me.  Actually, angering.  Now that the wet spots have dried up, I am not sure what or how damages will be tracked.  There is a HUGE gap in customer service in this thread.  AND, this has been a 6 month process.

Tyler's team were scheduled between 11 - 2, showed up at 8A (which we were actually really for so that's ok) Stranger dropped by during install, intimated he was with Kyle but apparently was just in area and decided to see what was happening.  Turns out he was on your security install team at another home in area.  Vivant changed my contract to less than what we signed for. After several missed appt. Tyler arrived 4/25 and placed missing panel.  Everyone at Customer Servicer was awesome (especially Anna) but I won't be recommending you to anyone.  Not enough communication between various teams resulted in me staying home from work waiting for tech who didn't show.  Inspector showed up at 7P 4/23 altho he was scheduled 4/24 and I called to cancel him when no tech showed that day. No call from a manager asking why we were having all these issues.   Customer Service (Anna) assisted and was kind and helpful as she could be) throughout the process but it's been a frustrating 4 weeks.",

Now I want the panels off my roof so I can go with another company. But no one will let me know if this is possible. I don't feel comfortable being tied to this company for 20 years!",

            "I live in Henderson Nevada. I started this adventure with you guys about 6 months ago. First of all. When I got my sure curity system from Vivint. There was a solar guy with him. So after everything was explained to me I decided to go for solar but I needed a financed. First you guys were selling solar without even your Finance Company even licensed yet to finance people in Nevada. So my finances went through and then were cancelled because the licenses were not in place. That was okay I was a little perturbed. So that basically took a couple months wait time to get their licenses and start the process of my solar system. The problem was I had to call and step everybody who was on this vivat team working on my solar what was going on. I let them know my finances were done after a week of waiting when I knew they were done. For someone on your team to pick this up and check for my finances. So I sent my emails out. To let them know my finances of gone through. Then I found out my electrical panel. Okay. I had to send an email out to find out what things were happening. Then I got an email saying that it had been scheduled its own so time for me to upgrade my panel. The contractor company you used was great they came out that day and stalled my panel and had it all done. I guess this company has worked for you before they said that they are going to get in touch with me and tell me when the city of Henderson was going to inspect my time use meter slot. So NV Energy can install their meter and my other meter. I waited two weeks I didn't hear anything. I did not know what's going on. Show I contacted by emails to the two people that are supposed to be handling this. One of them got back to me and says it was waiting a part. I'm thinking what part the electrician said it was done. So I waited a week. I heard nothing. So I have sent a message out to the two people it's supposed to be handling my solar Friday. And I got nothing back. So I called the main office to find out what is going on with my solar it's been 6 months. The lady on the phone has been the best out of your whole company. She found out what was going on. I guess the part that was missing is that there was a design change on my roof when they installed the panels. No one informed me I was waiting for this. Now I am waiting for them to approve the design change at Vivint. Then they're supposed to call the city of Henderson. I am very disappointed in Vivint. I think I should be pushed through a little faster than this. Since I'm one of the first people to get I guess financed for my own system versus least. At the moment I say Vivint been good. But that's basically it. Your company needs a coordinator where all the people that are on the list should at least get an update once a week. This is been the biggest problem besides the other one. No updates I had to send the emails now I'm getting nothing back. And now I get a survey. I hope the survey works. I feel like taking these panels off and I will get panels will take me a little longer to get installed but I won't have you guys. I am a very patient person as you seen. If I did know about this I would have never chosen Vivint Arvada all these problems and no updates or anything. So I am waiting for things to happen before I start sending out all my surveys all over the place telling how bad you guys have been. That's why I put on a number 5 on my satisfaction. If I'm showing them treated better and this thing is worked on and good communication I'm a fair person. So we'll see if the survey does anything?",

I put the system in at the end of March and I\u2019m still waiting.  I\u2019d like to reap some of the lower cost for electricity before summer ends.  It will do little benefit if I\u2019m not online before summer ends.  Had I known this, I would have waited until Fall to install and been spared the hassle of things through Spring and Summer.  Another summer with PG&E wouldn\u2019t have killed me.  And at this rate, I\u2019ll probably be with PG&E anyway.",

The hit city of Henderson wanted them to put a tap-in and a switch Block in my breaker for my generator. What I don't like is that they knew about this 3 months ago. When the guy was here to install my breaker block for my generator. He said he just ordered this last week. And the top kit should have been in last week. I got no call last week. What happened to my tap kit. As you can see I'm very upset with your company now. I've been very patient. If this doesn't get done soon I'm going to be contacting Better Business Bureau everybody who I can to get things going and even the news. Where's my tap kit.

I have had to follow up with every employee that has been working on this project. The only excuse for this unimaginable experience is I'm sorry for all the delays and then no one even calls back. I truly wanted to cancel my system and contract, because the job has been over a year  and has cost me personal time and a lost cost on savings that I can't get back cuz this install has turned into a nightmare.  I will tell every contact that is going solar from now on to never ever use this company.  This is the worst home install I have ever experienced.  I bet that this message will not get a deep enough reaction of concern with your management to fix or help me in this obvious neglect to care about the customer.",

            "I have several things that have made this a disappointing experience so far. First off my system was installed in early April and I received an email saying the inspection would be within the next 40 days however it took about 90 days ! Now that it has passed inspection I have received a new email that says it\u2019s going to take another 40 days to process the paperwork by the time this system is turn on It will have been close to 7-8 months which in my opinion is way too long of a process. Secondly I was referred to this company by a friend and I was told several times by the salesperson that my friend and I would receive a referral bonus of $500 and my friend would receive the same. I was told that I would receive this bonus via check 45 days after the install. At this point we have not received anything. I have Tried to contact that sales rep many many times via text,calls,and emails with no response whatsoever! I had no choice but to contact customer service a handful of times trying to get this referral bonus but was told that I needed something in writing!! So basically I was misled and lied to by the sales rep which I am very very upset by and it is not how a company that is asking customers to sign a 20 contract should conduct business. I hope someone reads this and steps up and does the right thing. Thanks \\Kris Waters",

It has been a month since PEPCO, my local electrical suppler came by to hook up the new netmeter.  I have not heard from Vivint as to when they are to come back out and replace the the feeder wire.  This is way beyond reason to not have the solar panels up and running.  If I had not sign a contract, I would have you come and take your equipment and go to another company for solar panels.  I was hoping to save money this summer on my electric bill with having to run window A/C's all the time.  Not going to happen now.  What kind of company are you running?

Vivint did pay for someone to fix the damage, but it took a while.  When Vivint sent someone out to hook up the initial electrical wiring, he used the same circuit as the air conditioner and disconnected the AC.
