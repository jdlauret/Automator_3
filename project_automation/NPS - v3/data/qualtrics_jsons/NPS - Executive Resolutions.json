            "I purchased the property with Vivint Solar already installed.  For 8 months I was charged for solar while the solar was not hooked up.  Being a novice , it took me awhile to notice an astronomical True Up bill which ended up at over $4200. At first the customer service was not any help in giving me information or even addressing my problem.  Finally after turning this company into BBB and the Contractor's board, the money owed me was returned.  However, the original estimate of panels needed on the house was inadequate (after only 2 years) and I have large solar bills and huge PGE bills. It seems the represenitative who sold the panels didn't know what they were doing.  ( I have another Solar company on other property so I have a comparison.) In order to adequately cover the house in solar energy, I would have to sign an additional and separate contract.  Now why would I be so stupid to add more misery with  an already incompetent company.  After getting embroiled in this mess, I checked the internet for other complaints and found that my complaint is common for Vivint customers.  I am considering filing or joining a Class Action Suit, I am that unhappy being stuck with this company.  Nancy Sanders, rental property 12618 Sawtooth, Bakersfield, CA.  You can solve my problem and yours by removing your panels and letting me out of the contract......",

However, the sales process and the after-sales/administration process were highly disappointing processes. It was hard to get any useful information, and what I did get turned out to be usually inaccurate. I have been a Vivint Security customer for about 4 years and think the security division is great.

I then contacted Vivint help desk who said they would help, however, no resolution.  We have been recently dealing with a Jordan who hasn't returned 5 messages.  His secretary relayed on Oct 12 that he mailed the check 8 days ago on Oct 5.  No resolution.  I cannot believe the trust that we put in your company and the lies that we have been told.  This is ridiculous and unprofessional.  I not only would n't recommend Vivint, but I am dissuading anyone to consider Vivint.  I have mailed David Bywater in hopes of some satisfaction.",

We pay pepco around $40.00  ompare to an average of $110.00 per month then you billed us an average of $75.00 per month not to mention it\u2019s still fall season going to winter and spring which means less time of sunlight every time. The problem came lately when Mr George Berry offered me another unit or set of pannels so I don\u2019t have to worry on my pepco bill. But the $85.00 that we pay for the solar power wich was our average billing from you gets double  our last moth solar bill was two $85.00 I can\u2019t understand these it is only me and my wife who stays at the house. Where are the savings from my electric bills if your company will charge us double for two units of panels. Can you send somebody to check on these matter. Another thing is after they install the second set of panels some of the nails on my celling starts coming off and a few parts of the drywall celing also few cracked.     We hope that you will do what ever necessary on these problems   Pls give us a call before you send somebody to handle our complaint.  Thanks and regards :  The Perez family",

I was promised $750 by my salesman as we were getting everything set up.  After installation, I could not reach my salesman about the $750, and after reaching Vivint customer service and several phone calls and lots of time in between phone calls, I was told my salesman no longer works at Vivint.  And then I was told that half of the installation bonuses come from the salesman, and therefore I would only receive half of my promised bonus.  This is unfair, and completely wrong to punish me over something I had no control over!  Vivint should make this right and stand by the offer that was given by one of their salesman.  When this was explained to me over the phone, I asked who I could talk to in order to appeal. I was told I could speak with no one, and the decision was final.  This is horrible customer service!  I had several friends, family and neighbors interested in my decision to go solar, and unless this gets resolved there is no way I can recommend your company.  A company must stand by its promises.  \\Trevan\\801-828-8100",

We only figured it out when we received a full bill from our electric company. The system stopped is finally fixed and now you are refusing to compensate us for any charges even though your failure at every step is the direct reason for us having to pay double (mosaic and duke energy) for the last theee months.

It took Vivint over 6 months to reinstall the solar panels and I was assured that Vivint would reimburse me for the electrical charges from Edison, which is still ongoing..... Almost every commitment made by Vivint employees has not been kept with the exception of Amanda is the resolutions department.  She is the only asset that I have found at Vivint.  The Executive offices are a joke and unresponsive and do not comprehend the magnitude of what this company has put me and my family through.  Also, I was told that the panels would be serviced and cleaned several time a year, this has never happened either.  Like every other department at Vivint, this little summary will most likely go without a response either......",

It has been 2-1/2 months since I contacted Vivint of the planned move so the solar could be connected to the first floor electic box.  Too many phone calls, too much confusion, too much hassle, no updates in over a week, and the solar is still connected to the 2nd floor electric box.  We asked about this possible move at the initial time of salesman conversation (Tristen Smith) as this was an important part of our decision to go with Vivint at the time we were researching and meeting with \"local\" solar companies.  In the last couple of months we have referred local friends and family to other solar companies.  We initially contacted Vivint as other family members in MA had also chosen Vivint as their solar company.  Recent conversations with these family members has confirmed they are also very unhappy with Vivint as well.  Shame on Vivint.  Shame, shame, shame.  My next phone calls and email contact is with the MA Attorney General's office.  We are extremely displeased with Vivint Solar and the services they have provided.",

In the meantime, I think he is either too busy or otherwise engaged to provide proper follow-up on our questions and problems.  It may not be his fault, as I think the Vivint world runs short handed and limits Adam's ability to actually step in to contact the correct people within the company directly for quick resolution to any problems, and he really does try to work through the problems and explanations with my household over the phone, but again the amount of contact by Adam has been pretty limited as well.  I think that for this most recent problem we are struggling with Vivint over, the amount of time this has been an open issue (initial contact with Vivint was 2/16/2018) is completely unacceptable, and Adam does not have the authority or training apparently to actually get it resolved quickly or pull in the correct people to do so.",

Tristin reassured us it would not be a problem.

Then I get a bill for energy    used when I have not seen one watt of electricity from the solar panels.

Your company offered to add more panels, they completed the work but it is now a second account for the second set of panels.  The device on the outside of the house that reports back to you my energy usage wasn't working, so you sent out a technician.  The technician determined there was a bad part that needed to be ordered.  At that time he shut off the switch to the malfunctioning device.  This was in July.\\\\Since then, I have been charged monthly for power produced based on whatever calculations you guys use to get an estimate - even though the power switch is off. I am paying you for literally no service.  I've been assured that the amount paid will be credited to my account in the future once you start receiving energy generation report data again.\\\\I have called multiple times to get someone to at least let me know the status of the part that needs to be replaced.  I have been assured by customer service that I would be contacted by the local office within 24-48 business hours.  I have made calls in August, September, and October, most recently talking to the customer service lead supervisor on 10/24/2018.  I have never been contacted back by the local office - even after being told by the lead supervisor that I'd be contacted by the end of day 10/26/2018.\\\\At this point, it probably could have been manufactured and shipped around the world.  I don't know why the local office wouldn't just replace the entire thing after this much time.  \\\\In addition, I recently logged into my account online to try and find additional contact information and I am unable to add either account to my online profile.  I just get the message \"Hmmm. Couldn't find that one.\" for either account number I enter.\\\\Please contact me back.",
