This had been discussed but not finalized. Cal South never got a hold of me or my wife to confirm. We arrived home around 11 am to find no power in the house with about 15 guests to cook for that were visiting from various locations to include France and London. We had to wait several hours before we were able to put away groceries (luckily they were in coolers because we had just travelled back from Temecula from our wedding). When I contacted Vivent, they took ZERO responsibility for this claiming it all fell on the subcontractor to contact me. I could agree with this if a) I had hired the subcontractor, or b) I had chosen a subcontractor and had waived liability from Vivent. Neither of these things occurred. This is not the first time contractors have shown up unannounced or unscheduled. It\u2019s the THIRD. It then took 48 hours for a supervisor to return my call. This is completely unsatisfactory. I\u2019m very glad I waited for the process to be complete before recommending this company. Our family lunch was completely disorganized due to your lack of communication which was extremely embarrassing to both myself and wife.

There are 6 anchors that missed the rafters and we were told a Service person would come out and repair the damage, that was over 3 weeks ago and nothing has been done, not even a call to schedule the repairs.\\The original controller to operate the first solar system had to be reset to communicate with the WIFI router, this process to make it work again took the service person several hours and he had to call the office to talk with a technician, it did not appear to be the service person so much as the controller and electronics.\\I will again this February receive a bill for electrical service from our utility company, SDGE for over $1,000 and yet your company stated everything was working and supplying approximately 95% of solar electricity and this happened the year before also.  This controller does not have the capability to let us see what it is producing, this is a major error in Vivint Solar controller equipment.  The 2nd system is supposed to allow us to monitor the output ourselves.  This should be the equipment used on all installations.  At this point, I do not trust Vivint due to misinformation from the company and several of its employees.",

We understand delays but REALLY, a 3 YEAR DELAY!!?? IS RIDICULOUS!!!    No one in your company seems to know what the other is doing.  The departments do not know what is going on with our account . We call a number given to us and are told, That is not my area, Ill have someone get back to you.  When and if someone does return our call, they have no answers .  We had a Vivant person scheduled to come out to our home yesterday, Monday Feb.12th 2018 to look over our basement that has flooded due to the BIG hole beside of our house under the solor box hanging on side of our house.  Well, No one showed up.  I did see someone in a Vivant vehicle at our neighbors yesterday morning .  I felt sure they would realize they were at the wrong house and come to us, but they  NEVER DID. \\You Peaple are REDICULIOUS !!! \\Carole Harding and Kathy Harding Kline\\4212 Bussard Rd.\\Middletown, MD 21769\\3013715193",

The contractors that came to install a new control box and remove the old one were not so great. The work lead was very polite and professional, but his assistant was mouthy to him and quit in the middle of the work- rather than staying at home for a half a day, I had to be there all day so that the Lead could to the work by himself.  There was a sizable hole left by my old fuse box and I was told someone would follow up on the repair (install was on a Wednesday).  I contacted Vivint on a Monday because I don't want anything to crawl into the hole.  Trae and his assistant Kathleen responded right away and told me someone is coming out tomorrow.  I have a lot of faith in the core company, but the sub contractors need some work.",

They put some filler in the hole but could not put touch up paint as we do not have the paint can anymore nor was I going to allow them to cut a hole into my wall to take to the paint store to match!  Then they would have two holes!  Now as of 7/9/18 10:38pm I notice in my bedroom the ceiling is looking like there are bubbles in it! We just had our first summer rainstorm and looks to us there is a leak where the solar panels have been installed!!!!! Now you all will have to come back out to repair the roof and water damage to our house!  The solar has not even been turned on yet!!! What the heck? This is really unacceptable. I expect to have a phone call with someone tomorrow ASAP! We have another chance for thunderstorms starting tomorrow morning! 619-307-1436",

We have all this Summer sun that is going to waste that could be used because of the use of the Air Conditioner having to run all the time.

We are waiting to hear when the next part of the job wil be done and when we can expect to be up and running.  We are sorry that this horrendously hot summer has given us the usual high electric bills.  Hoping we are up and running soon.

I called the city of La Mesa to see if they had done a final inspection.  They had not. The La Mesa inspector came out the following morning and said the installation was NOT complete. Vivint has so far , has given me no explanation for the delay.  Vivint replaced the roof on my rental house and put new shingles over roofing boards that were loaded with dry rot and termites.  Now I have to have the shingles removed and those boards replaced. before the solar panels can be installed.  Thanks for listening",
