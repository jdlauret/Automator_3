I recently called because the solar quit working. I was given an appointment for a service person to come out which was 5 weeks out! It took a week to have a supervisor call me back.I had by this time contacted another solar company to come and take a look they were able to come out the same day. It was a very simple problem one of the breakers was wired in with our pool  equipment and only needed to be turned back on after we had our pool winterized. The other solar companies also send someone out once a year to simply check the panels and output I was beyond disappointed to find that even when the system isn't working at all it takes over a month to get someone out.",

            "I do not usually take the time to complain unless there is a more serious issue, however, Vivint Solar has been extremely unsupportive and ineffective and show very little concern for their customers.\\ \\I all but had to beg Vivint Solar to remove my panels so that I may re-shingle my house on account of storm damage, which, potentially may have leaked water inside after 7 rain days, 3 of which were severe. I had paid my $500.00 obligation called 5 sperate times and was suprised to see that it still took 2 months to remove them.\\ \\In addition to the already tarnished representation of Vivint, a crew finally, after a month, came back to put my panels back on. Not only did your crew take 7, I repeat, 7 hours to put an 11 panel system up, it took 7 hours to put an 11 panel system up that was already fitted and hooked up with brackets still in my roof. 7 hours I had to put off my life and obligations so I could stay because the crew needed my wifi username and password when they were finished. Not only is this extremely unfair to the customer but it is borderline stealing from the company on lost wages and business. I am not 100% how long it takes to put these up, but I can only imagine if it took the original crew to install the entire system in under half the time, your crews are being negligant.\\ \\Also, when finished your crew failed to clean any of their materials and trash. I found, so far, four rain buster tubes, which my I ended up finding after I saw my dog chewing on one of them that was half full. Also, if his health is negatively affected, which, last night he wouldnt eat I will be taking legal action. Four rain buster tubes, bunjee cord, crews water bottles, and a roll of vivint tape in both the front an back yard. These things werent hidden or tucked in a corner. it was in middle of my yard in both the front and back.\\ \\I would like to know what exactly should be done about this, as not only am I extremely upset, I have reported the company to Better Busines Beureau (BBB). This lack of customer service is for lack of better words, awful, and I will take all steps to ensure others don't sign into contract if this is how all customers are treated. It is unfair and the lack of professionalism is not how a company should be run. Please excuse my rant as I am very upset.\\\\My roof, as a result, has started leaking and now have to wait for Vivint to come fix this..",

And now I am stuck with a 20 yr contract with a company that is not saving us money at all, as a matter of fact it is costing us more than before Vivint! So we are not happy with Vivint right now!  We just had one of your service guys come out and tell us that we have not been offline for the last 6 mos. So 6 mos later you come to check upon it to let us know. And now I have an almost 600.00 electrical bill on top of your almost 200.00 bill. So no I will not refer Vivint to anyone!",

            "Everything with contracting and initial installation several years ago was easy, painless, and comforting by staff who answered every question as it is not easy going from a power company for many years to solar without really knowing much about it. For the first several years, all was good, and all is good now and I am proud to be a solar energy producer, and brag it up to all who isn't. The $ savings are awesome. Where Vivint needs to improve is when the system on the roof needs to come down for housing repairs. Our house caught fire last January, no damage to the solar equipment, but it needed to be removed. The removal process was fairly effortless, a few phone calls, emails and $499.00 ( which I was told would only be $300.00 when we signed the agreement several years earlier), but that was okay. The real hardship started when it came time for re-installation. It became very clear the young folks running things in Utah had absolutely no clue who their installation crews were let alone how to schedule them to work here in Arizona. After numerous calls to the Utah office and my wife having to wait hours at the construction site in Arizona summer heat because with no solar, no electricity, thus no air conditioning, but if she was not there when the crew showed up, they would leave. Nobody told her the crew changed her appointment until later that afternoon. But eventually, the panels where put back up and the installers did a nice job. I received an email to arrange for the power company to install the meter and turn it on. The power company came out as I scheduled but they could not do it as they said there was no power to the box. The power company was able to turn their power back on to us, but not with solar. So, I started getting their expensive bills, each time with me wondering when Vivint was going to fix it. This led to more/ numerous calls to the Vivint Utah folks who conterdicted this and said it was the power companies responsiblity. But Vivint sent out a technician who inspected the wiring in the panel box who said it was all hooked up correctly. He said the wires were \"Crispy\" but functional. So with this, the Vivint Utah folks left it up to me to make all arrangements from there to get the power company back out to pull the switch. Vivint folks said the power company was their competition and was deliberately being difficult to discourage people from going to solar. I told this yo the power company folks who denied it, but the power company employee gave me the phone number to the installation Vivint folks but nobody returned my call. Oh, one other thing, everytime I called Utah, I could not speak with anybody but the person who was simply a messenger between me and technical personnel, which led to constant delays between calls and waiting for return calls from the messenger, which led to more questions which I had to wait for another response delay. I actually took time off work and it took an entire day of back and forth calls when I finally gave up and my last message was I was going to stop automatic payment withdrawals until the power was reconnected and to be arranged by Vivint. I paid $500  for removal and installation but I was doing all the scheduling and I was done with it. A few days later, I received an email from the power company of a scheduled appointment to reconnect, then I received an email from Vivint that they would send a Vivint tech out too for the appointment. I took time off from work to be there too as Lisa did not want anything to do with it anymore. The Vivint tech showed up first for the appointment ( not the same guy as before). He opened the power panel to find, the wires to the circuit switch where not hooked up. The power company tech waited about an hour while the Vivint tech hooked the wires up using borrowed tools from me and the power company tech. After all was hooked up, all was smooth sailing, back on solar. A few days later, the Vivint tech who came out first and inspected the crispy wires but good and all were hooked up came by the house and asked my wife if he could re- inspect the second tech's work. First tech was nothing but insulting of the second tech's workmanship to which my wife replied that at least he saved you from your careless and lazy work. I was there the entire time the second tech hooked up the wires, he was a true professional and gentleman who didn't talk down about the first tech or Vivint and with my conversation with him as he worked he is the only person with Vivint who restored my faith in the company. I wish I could remember his name, but he is a credit to Vivint. The first tech created so much headaches due to his lazy, haphazard inspection. One other thing, after the panels were removed, I received numerous emails from Vivint  that stated they detected a fault in the system. For the first few, I responded with the panels were removed. But, this didn't stop the emails. Then I got phone calls from Vivint, which I replied the panels were removed. Then I received one more call from Vivint about a fault in the system, right about the time I was trying to get Vivint to hook the wires up. So with this call, the Vivint caller said he was going to send someone out to learn why the system was not working. I accepted. No tech ever came out and I did not get anymore emails or phones about it being down, when at that time, the panels were back up and the system was actually not working.  I realize this was a long rant, and all is good now. But Vivint really needs to improve their communications and technical support in real situations as with our situation. I am sure you receive numerous service calls from customers that need to be screened by an answering employee, but with customers who have house fires or other catostrophic incident, make closer one on one communication a priority. Again, I do talk a lot to other people about solar, I mean a lot of people, and I am very happy to have solar and I praise Vivint.",

That guy damaged my roof, was promised that it would be fixed. No one came to fix the roof. Was told that new panels were approved, and I would be contacted when they would start install That was months ago. Tried to contact Philip Chamberlain multiple times, no call back. Called Vivent, was told they would contact him, no call back. No new panels, no $500 gift card, no one fixed my roof.

He advised, that he did promise that referral, but due to changes in the policy , I would not be getting my referral. I called you company, and emailed your company, and got a run around. It's been 4 months and no referral fee. Your company is dishonest and not customer friendly. I will NEVER, EVER refer another person to this crooked dishonest company. HORRIBLE!",

I am paying both you \"Vivint\" and my provider \"SDG&E\" every single month with SDG&E amounting to an average of $35 a month.  That translates to a running bill of over $400 - $450 when it trues up in 12 running months.  I asked to begin the process of augmenting the existing syatem and I find out I need to cosume more for the next size augmentation (12 pannels) to meet the requirements so as not to overproduce.  I need to be witin the 10% of the production vs consumption so SDG&E does not proceed legally due to the new laws that relate to solar power.  I was told something different when your fomrer employee representative came to my home to make the sales pitch.

Vivint emails me a bill around the 11th of the month and expects payment by the 20th. When they do not gt it they send annoying reminders that do no good as I pay my bills around the 30th of the month. Additionally, when one goes to the website to pay, it is set up so poorly that it actually says nothing is due! One has to push two additional tabs or buttons to discover that it is a past due amount. Any reasonable web designer would know how to show the customer immediately exactly what is due without making them jump through hoops! If you can solve these problems I would be a very satisfied customer. Thank you.",

Information was repeatedly left out during conversations with Vivint Customer Reps. NEVER in all the calls was a promise to call back executed. EVERY time we had to initiate the call back. Most notably I was asked when, and what number should we contact you tomorrow to answer your question. My response, 9AM at ####, was accepted and a return call promised. 9:30 I called them. \"He doesn't get here until 10\" was what I was told (why agreee to call me if you won't be at work at that time?). \"We'll have him call you at 10\". 10:30 I called \"Oh, he's in a meeting, he'll call you later today\". I wore my headset all day- No call. I called at 5PM. \"He's gone home for the day\". This has been the typical Customer Service treatment from your representatives. I AM NOT PLEASED WITH THIS TREATMENT. There is more. Check the history of my account.",

But it seems like its a waste of time for Vinvint Co. To arrange for more panels my annual was up this June 2017 it was over $700 cause it wasn't Producing enough energy how does a customer suppose to pay for a Large amount annually .

Cost for electricity from National Grid is rising at about 2.7% annually, so my Vivint cost will probably equal National Grid cost soon.\\\\Also, the billing has not improved, since Vivent was bought out by the new company.  We used to receive our monthly bill via e-mail on the 3rd or 4th of the month; now it's later than the 10th.  I just received an e-mail today (9th) saying my July invoice was ready.

Then having the solar panels reinstalled, that took another 3 months, which was unacceptable, causing me to have to pay HIGH electricity bills again since I had no solar power.  I had to threaten legal action to get any activity out of vivint then my sales rep got involved and he took care of everything within a few days.  He is a great asset to Vivint, but customer service and communication needs much improvement.  I may or may not recommend vivint to someone else solely because of my experiences with Vivint.

It took months, too many phone calls to Vivint, and zero follow-up/return calls from Vivint before they eventually deployed someone to my house to investigate.  It then took three separate visits from the Vivint technicians before the bracket (laying on my property for months) was reinstalled onto the system front.  I wish someone would come to my house to inspect the work.  The \u201cbrackets\u201d supporting the solar panels are still not installed properly, and I am concerned that panels/brackets could fall off the roof.  A visit from a Vivint inspector would be so appreciated, and a safe thing to do given such a large piece feel off and damaged my landscape.  Unfortunately Vivint will not accomodate.  I will just have to wait for something else to fall off my roof.  Until this incident I touted Vivint, and recommended the service often.  I no longer do that, and advise neighbors and interested passers not to waste time with Vivint - - and instead seek out a solar company with better Customer Support, a belief in safety, as well as demonstrated customer follow-up and satisfaction.  I am still left with an unsafe situation.",

You believe good customer service is lying to your customers and when they try to get out of an very very bad deal. The bullying and threats start. I will go to every social media site in order to warn everyone about Vivint Solar. I will go around my neighbor hood to warn everyone about you. I will spend the next years letting everyone know who and what you are, I am far from a satified customer.  I hope is you do something legally wrong and get sue so I can appear in court for the person suing you so I can tell about my experiance and the hell your company put me through.  I promise I will never stop complaining about how horrible an experiance I am having with your company. Please collect the monthly payment you are stealing from me and don't contact me for a survey.

And that at the end of the year I would have to pay a lot to cover the amount that solar did not cover. It was over $500. And a service to actually clean the panels would be nice. They look super dirty. And I think but don't know but think dirt hinders the sun going into the panels. And would be nice if I got a letter in mail every six months or year asking me is there anything you could do for me. I feel like a lost child. This is probably why I would have to explain to everyone how I feel if anyone asked about my solar. I did share your info to a lot of people at the beginning of this story but have now stopped. Thanks for asking",

However I'm paying you 15.5 cents for the power and the excess sells to PG&E for 2 cents so it shouldn't be considered a selling point. On a different matter I moved into the house in December and have gotten bills every month however I come to find out that the system hasn't been connected to the internet for the 5 months and you have no idea what my production is. So the Billing is a made up number! I called in and asked about this and all I got was a chuckle and a \"I'll look into it and get back to you\" which never happened.  Now that it's connected to the internet I call in and you can't even tell me if the bill for the latest month reflects what my system has made in a month or the accumulation since I took over the plan or since it was last disconnected from the system. It just seems really fishy, like something's going on behind the scenes. I can't find any of the past production data so I cant even verify your numbers. So from my point of view there is nothing stopping you from making up whatever kind of bill you want, charging me for it, and leaving me completely unable to protect myself.",

When they installed my solar the put nails thru my roof which they tried to fix twice but I still have one nail pertruding through my living room roof. In addition, when I complained about my $200 dollar PG&E bill for Dec 2016 no one returned my call until February. I was told I would be getting a large refund & it resulted in only a few dollars. I would have never signed up for solar had I known I would be saving such a small amount for such a huge inconvenience for 20 years.",

After speaking with an agent, another three weeks later one technician shows up unaware the house was a two story even though I confirmed this with an agent the day before.

I still have no new appointment and headed to Japan now for Navy travel with no resolution. Thanks for making my family and I feel not important.",

            "I do not know if your company has ever heard of \"CUSTOMER SERVICE\". I started a copybook of all the dates,times, and people I have spoke with and from all the different departments. I have been having problems with my system since day 1, May 10, 2016. I heard the electrician say OOPS. i THINK i FRIED SOMETHING. Something a customer does not want to hear since I have this so called product for 20 years. Anyway, I called your company on Nov. 16, 2016 to tell them my system was not working. This was the 3rd or 4th time I have brought this to your attention. Several days later I receive a call from a Joreen Kepa letting me know that I have a problem. 6 months later and about 12 phone calls the problem is still not RESOLVED. I have made 6 appointments with your company . All the appointments you have gave me, I did not choice the day, I did pick a time slot. Out of the 6 scheduled appointments, ZERO were made. I had to call your company to find out what was going on. Only 2 appointments did I get a call. The other 4 were a no show and nocall as received. They even said they called. So, I went back and pulled all my voicemails and I.D. calls and NOTHING was received. Most of my calls get forwarded to my cell number , and nothing was received.So far, this year I have lost 6 days to sit it to wait for NO ONE. I said it before,many times, If I could have these things taken off my roof and have my $10,000 new roof replaced I would do it yesterday. I also said if anyone in your company has a BACKBONE (politely said) they would forward this to David Bywater. I wonder if he knows what is going on in his company. If so, he is a sad representation of a leader or president.  I say this since I worked in a company an assisant customer service manager or a customer service manager. If I did have the things your company has done to me , I would have been FIRED  many years ago. Lets see if the tech team makes it out here on the next visit. It's funny, I now keep getting emails saying I have problems with my system. All I can say is NO !?@#. Just think , I have 19 more years of this CRAP to deal with. Hopefully, When I go to sell my house in 6 years, I do not have a problem because the system does not work correctly and is not fixed 100%. If this happens it sounds like a possible litagation problem.",

Our electric bills have been less, at first.  In January 2017 we had a representative come to us and encourage us to add more panels since our electric bills were still quite high.  Those panels were up in March, 2017 and still have yet to be connected.  We failed inspection due to our electrical box that needed to be replace. It was to be replaced and the 1st appointment was cancelled (May).  We were not scheduled in June, person came out and the box they brought was not the right size.  They measured and made another appointment for July.  Again, wrong size box.  2 more appointements since July 24 have been cancelled - all by vivant.  We had to make arrangements each time to be at the house - and one of the times we were on vacation so our son took a day off of work to be present.  Our vivant bill this month was $190 and our electric bill is at an all time high of $175 for the summer.  When I called Vivant about the bills, I was informed that our panels AT NOT connected, none of them are - and our bills are being estimate!!!!! Our bill does not say that.  What are we paying for since we are getting NO SERVICE from vivant.  To say the least, we are NOT HAPPY with solar and would NOT recommend anyone to connect with vivant.  We are really hoping for a \"happy ending\" to this story!",

            "We are pleased so far with the actual service, however we were promised by our agent that we'd receive a $500 rebate from him once we finalized our contract. To this date, after contacting him numerous times, we still have not received the rebate. Also, in an effort to earn extra money to help pay for our solar panels through your referral program, we gave our agent well over 20 names of people for him to contact and not one has been contacted yet, and this has been nearly a year ago. We have neighbors and friends we recommended who have since bought solar through other companies as a result. We were also told that since we don't have any earned income and don't qualify to receive a tax return, that once of our children could claim the credit and give it to us to help pay down our solar panels. In doing our taxes this year we found that it's not possible to that, so we're totally screwed out of get the tax advantages...which is the ONLY reason we finally agreed to buy the panels in the first place. This means the payments for the panels will eventually cost us more than what we will be saving. We're on a fixed income, as we explained to our agent, and cannot afford any extra expenses. If we could have you remove the panels and just go back to the way we were before without them, it'd be much better for us! Not too happy about all of this!!!!!!",

I was recently \"reached out to\" by one of your managers to see if I would like to use my home as an \"example\" and I said NO until someone came out to properly install the system, as I now get a lot of shade during the winter when I need more electrical generation.  But due to the current install that won't ever happen.  He said he would get someone to \"reach out to me\" but its been over a month.  Also, I've called in multiple times about the shoddy installation and no one has contacted me in over 3 years.  So NO, I'm not in the mood to recommend VIVINT to anyone at this time. I'm sorry to say, but it seems all VIVINT is interested in is bringing in more customers,....at least it seems that way to me, as no one has \"REACHED OUT\" to me about this poor install done by your sub-contractors!",

Two weeks ago PG&E, and a private contractor, connected the panels to the grid.  However, the panels have not been turned on because you have not come out to do so.  Our true up period ends in August, we thought we would have the warm \\August sun to help generate extra electricity to help cut this cost.  We are waiting for you to turn on the extra panels.  Why put them on if you don't finish the work?",

            "John, my sales person, was awesome! The install guys were great too....I had a brand new carport cover that they came in the morning cool and installed then so there would be no rips in it! Great job all around. Vivant was very good to me in the sales process and the initial install of the panels.\\\\After the install, my stove stopped working and the man sent to fix it strongly insisted that the issue was not caused by Vivant. After he left, I began to think it through and made another call. Another guy was sent out who immediately diagnosed the problem which WAS caused during the install and fixed it. Wonderful! I had to make numerous calls, particularly after the first gentleman came out, to get this resolved. This went on for about 4 weeks, with an extension cord run out from behind the stove in my kitchen to another outlet. It wasn't a show-stopper, but was jerry--rigged for over a month, numerous calls had to be made with some strong conversations particularly after the first guy came out, and precious Time spent finally getting resolution.\\\\During the contract signing, I agreed to allow Vivant to automatically withdraw from my account the bill due for Vivant services each month and that cannot be changed according to the contract. I totally overestimated how much solar was actually going to save me and, thinking the amount withdrawn each month would be small, contractually agreed to allow Vivant to do that. The bill has actually climbed to over several hundred dollars, which must be  paid each month, but the way Vivant billing works, there is no flexibility to move the withdrawal to the date the rest of my bills are paid. My other bills that are automatic withdrawal are set amlounts and the Vivant bill varies and is climbing, with no way to anticipate what it will cost each month and no flexibility to get it earlier in the month so I know what money is available for the rest of the month for my household budget. There is no flexibility for the customer and I have had some pretty strong feelings about an automatic withdrawal that is much larger than I thought it was going to be, contractually bound to it for the next 20 years, and no flexibility at all to move it earlier in the month so I can at least budget effectively.",

A monthly assessment of our equipment, a phone call, yearly maintenance check, cleaning of panels, tree growth changes/needs, any changes with PG&E...any of this \"follow up\" would be appreciated.

            "Though my relationship with Vivint started out promising, it turned sour relatively fast. You have my panels too close to my ridge vent on the southwestern side of my roof, and the snow blows and collects there and when it melts, it drips inside my attic/house. It has come thru my main living area ceilings in 2 places, which I repainted, but it will happen again the next winter we have blowing accumulating snow (which is almost every winter). I contacted Vivint and they won't do anything to solve the problem. Sick of the hassle. I've apologized to all my friends who did get Vivint per my recommendation (prior to the 1st snowy winter when we had a problem). I 100% will discourage ANYONE from getting their solar from you until you fix this problem on my roof.  I'm now counting down the years left in my contract with Vivint. Please contact me if someone at Vivint is willing to step up and do the right thing. I put my faith in your expertise. And now my house will continue to be damaged practically every winter until I can remove these panels at the end of my obligation to you.",

I did not really win that much because I have now 2 payments to the solar panels and the Edison comp,  I will love to have a courtesy visit to see if the hold in the ruff did not damage my ruff and is not licking when rain.

Also, the sales representative who helped us promised us a Visa gift card once our neighbor's solar installation was complete; however, he never followed through, even after several reminders. We also were led by him to believe that selling our house wouldn't be a problem because that would nullify the 20 year agreement and the new owners would be able to choose whether to keep the solar panels or have them removed. Since then, we've learned that the new owners would have to pay a hefty fee to have the panels removed. Had the sales representative been honest with us up front, we would not have chosen to enter an agreement with Vivant Solar. (Our sales rep was Tad Thueson.)",

I can\u2019t see my daily production therefore Vivint can\u2019t either so they has been estimating my bills the entire time I have been with Vivint. No one is monitoring my system, a customer should never go more than a month with estimated bills. That should be a red flag to the company that something is wrong and contact the customer; instead of waiting for an infuriated customer to call them when things don\u2019t look right. Also bills don\u2019t have enough information on them as to how they come up with my production number, especially since then aren\u2019t even receiving my production information in the first place!

Received a delay in response and no one can give me an answer on adding more panels.  Was told an assumption that I would have to re-enter back in to a 20 year contract.  I'm still not understanding why.  Would ask that you inquire to my matter on adding two panels on the back of the garage and provide an explanation on how I am getting billed.\\\\Respectfully,\\Ron",

(Not your fault) within a couple weeks we ended up with a huge pigeon problem. They make multiple nests under the panels and can be heard at all hours of the night. Not to mention the mess they make. We actually have eggs rolling off the roof onto our patio. I called right away when we noticed this issue and was told by multiple people that the Fleet Department would come out and install Bird hazing/fencing around the panels so the birds couldn't get under there and nest. A person came out and broke up 3 or 4 nests and fixed some of the fencing that had come loose and was blowing in the wind. He told me that he didn't have the right material to add new barriers but he would send his boss a message to get a crew out. Never happened. I've called multiple times and I've been told you no longer offer that service. I was told one thing at first now another. I go up once a week to break up nests and haze the birds away. I never had a bird problem until the panels were installed. Pretty frustrating. Especially since we have a 9 month old baby and sleep is of a minimum.",

I guess I missed all that during the time I bought it. It was quite a disappointment to get that bill.

After several calls, a whole summer and the same electric bill I always had, I should have a tech out this Friday. The only thing I see so far is another bill to you, a 20 year contract and no savings that I was told I would see. And what about that referral bonus? My in-laws got  panels installed. After initial contacts with other referrals, no other follow up. I maybe should have went with a local solar company. That's my fault.",

But even more frustrating is the system was installed without bird guards and we now host a ton of birds that crap all over our front and back yard.  We do not even go out and enjoy the yard anymore because of our fear of getting crapped on.  After numerous threatening phone calls from my husband the guards were eventually installed, but a little too late.  The birds are here to stay.  We will probably pay the $500 fee to have this un-installed.  Extremely disappointed in the entire experience!",

Thank you & Aloha, Brittany.....\\but STILL, we are not totally satisfied with our service from Vivint.    unfortunately, we have a 25 year lease to legally uphold....so basically, we are 'stuck' with Vivint for the next 20 or so years....",

Our system was turned on before the city inspection was completed. When I notified Vivant, I got the run around. Nobody wanted to talk to me and when someone finally did all he kept saying was \"your power bill is reduced, right?\" When the inspection was finally completed nobody notified me, I had to call Vivant again. Then I had questions about our power generation because I still had a large power bill to pay. When I sent in the information requested I got an email back saying billing couldn't help me and it had been forwarded to fleet services. I still have not been contacted. I'm very disappointed in the level of professionalism and service your company provides.",

I am paying more money to my energy company and you guys are losing money. Just doesn't make sense from a customer and business perspective. When it is fixed, I expect to be compensated for extra money I have to pay which is going to cost you even more!",

WHY  WOULD I WANT YOU TO PUT YOUR PANNELS ON MY HOME SO THAT I CAN SPEND MORE MONEY FOR MY UTILITIES, As I am now spending about $60 per month to pg&e for my electric bill plus back payment for my true up bill. and I refuse to pay vivit as the panels were disconnected as of JULY 1, 2016 and I have repeatedly requested that u remove your panels of my property ... DEALING WITH VIVIT AS BEEN ONE BIG NIGHTMARE IN MY LIFE...   AS I have been threating with law suits... so PLEASE take me to court because you guys lied to me... I was also told in the beginning that I was buying these panels and just for using them I would own them in 20 years....another LIE? I need to save $$$ not throw it away.... PLEASE TAKE ME TO COURT AS I HOPE TO EXPOSS HOW CROOKED YOUR COMPANY HAS BEEN TO ME... Sincerely John A. Bonilla",

When I called to discuss the matter over a 1/2 hour minimum wait on hold AND when I do get someone wrong dept. One day I asked several times to speak to a supervisor I was ignored. Even thought vivant has been to my house several times the last time they came out they were unprepared they stayed 1 1/2 hrs did nothing them told me they had other appointments and had to leave ....I guess other clients are more important than my family... solar hasn't worked correctly since day one. Stellar service and great phone service never saw a company pass the buck or make someone sit on the phone all day just aggravating!!! pass the word I am",

When someone finaly came they noticed it was never turned on from inside the box that was installed outside. We called in and spoke with 1 man who was actually polite and respectful thumbs up to him he assured me I would be reimbursed at least what I was promised which is 60% of my electric bill which equals about 2000 not what I would want since we were pretty much lied too by your company another man who I didn't speak with spoke to my wife and said we were getting 1000 and that she was lucky she got that because if it was him we wouldn't even get that so we now have a 2000 bill to pay and we are contacting attorneys",

            "The entire experience is a major dissapointment from installation to turning the system on to working through the billing process.  There is absolutely no way to get to problems resolved.  I have a dozen phone calls that were never returned, I have two dozen emails that are just simply ignored.  It is clrearly obvious that once a contract is signed, vivint cares very little about its customers.  I have a credit balance that was promised to me on June 23, 2016 (I think it is important to include the year because it took 26 month to complete installation.)  I have not seen that credit yet.  I was issued a reimbursement check that bounced in May 2016.  I was promised to be reimbursed for the bank charge of $17 that never happened.  Not only will I not reccomend Vivint I will do everything in my power to make sure that every person I know is aware of the treatment I have received from Vivint Solar.",

Not only did we see only very minimal to no savings, we were hit by a huge \"catch up\" bill from SCE at the end of the year. (we live in So Cal so sunshine is not an issue at all). It was unexpected and the response from Vivant was slow, unapologetic and unhelpful. We were told to put more panels on our home. No  other solutions were offered and, in fact, they just reiterated that we signed a 20 year contract so we would be sued if we had them take the panels off or if we turned them off ourselves.  They didn't even offer a token response to alleviate our anger and frustration.  So instead of feeling good about the decision to go solar, we are reminded each month of how we are NOT saving any dollars, how we were NOT treated as valued customers and how we are stuck allowing such a terrible company make money off of our property for the next 20 years.",

We never received shirts we asked for or any flags saying we had vivinit solar to help advertise to our neighbors. Very poor service.",

Before our system was approved, Vivint sent an unlicensed technician to our house with very dangerous instructions that could have electrocuted him. We told him not to proceed with his work order and it was subsequently fixed by a licensed electrician.  I've tried to change the account name from my husband's name to my name. I sent the transfer agreement with both our signatures and the account name is still not changed. The solar system appears to be working now but after reading about our experiences I expect you'll understand why I cannot recommend Vivint to my friends or neighbors.",

My account mgr does not respond to my emails any longer,  he just forwards them to the damage department who never follow up with me. \\3) the installation crew left Gatorade bottles, a vodka bottle, food wrappers and installation pieces on our roof. Our roofer found them and removed them. \\4) junk was left in our lawn and caused damage to our gardners lawn mower. \\5) The holes they made, and did use to stall the brackets were not caulked or sealed so we will be having water damage this winter.\\5) I'm looking at an attorney to help me solve this because my phone calls and emails, which started nicely and are now just direct and to the point, are never followed up on.",

In the summer months it has cost us over two hundred dollars to pay for the solar energy that we produce.  However, we have only received a $31.00 credit on our electric bill. So far, on the whole, solar energy is going to wind up costing us money rather than saving us money.  Also, your billing and business practices are unspecific and arbitrary.  For the first 3 months that we were connected, our envoy was not communicating through our modem. However, when we logged on to our account, it said that our system was operating normally.  Then, we were charged $90.00 extra one month in order to make up for the fact that you had underestimated the amount of electricity that we were producing.  We seriously regret signing on with your company and would like to be released from our contract.  Since that is unlikely, we will have to settle for warning everyone we know to steer clear of you.",

A month later I logged into the Vivint website to check my output.  The screen showed  \"Your system is operating normally\" and my output for the past 7 days was 0kWh.  My system was reporting no output and your systems again did not flag an error.  I now check the Envoy system directly because I know Vivint does not actively monitor my solar system.

Our initial sales associate was personable and helpful but he had to move and was replaced with an equally friendly associate who walked up through everything and answered all of our questions.  We were initially a little skeptical because of the door to door selling aspect but we had been wanting solar power and this seemed like an easy and cheap way to get solar panels.  It took a few months to get the panels turned on after they were installed, which I understand is because of other organizations like the power company and the city inspectors.  But we are happy with our power and it has been so inexpensive over the summer compared to our bills the last few years.",

The day he was supposed to come, he never showed up. A few days later I got a call that I needed to reschedule because he was sick or something that day. So they reschedule me for ANOTHER MONTH further down the road. Two months to get someone to check my system seems nuts, especially for a company your size. I asked the scheduler if we could get it closer, since it wasn\u2019t my fault it was canceled, and she said there was nothing available.  So, I guess that\u2019s been my biggest complaint. That, and that this communication failure has happened like three times since I\u2019ve had solar installed at the the house back in the summer. Thanks for listening!",

At that time we were also dealing with a roof leak. We paid your fee to have our panels removed and stored, (never heard a word again until I called 2 weeks later to find out when I was getting my appointment). It turns out my paperwork had never even moved on to the next step on your end. When that got pushed through it turns out the soonest appointment we could get for panel removal was the end of January. Had to delay a day for snow. Now I need to wait on the roofer because we are in the middle of a NY winter- which I told your scheduling people would happen when they said I needed to wait for 7 weeks for an appointment. I still have a leak and my panels still aren't working . We aren't happy- as the homeowners we feel like we are being held \"hostage\" by you and your inefficiency when it comes to maintaining our home.",

Even though the insurance paid for this, they didn't take into the consideration what we went through after the check was accepted.

Several home owners in our area asked our opinion about Vivintsolar  & I told them of my experience. I found out the hard way don't trust sales people all they care about is close the deal.

            "I had to get the shingles replaced on my roof.  I called many times over the course of months to get an appointment to get the panels removed.  There was was always a reason the appointment couldn't be made (spec sheet isn't on the computer, the computer is down, you don't have a credit check in the system are three reasons that I recall).  I finally got the panels removed and the roof was replaced the next week.  I called to say the panels could be replaced.  I got a response three months later.  I asked why it took so long.  I was told that the cable was cut to remove the panels, and a replacement wasn't available.  This is hard to imagine.  The panels are supposed to be replaced in March.  You have lost over 4 months of income, and it will have been about a half year between the time I first asked to have the panels removed until they will be replaced.  I'm not sure where your breakdown is occurring, but having managed a customer support group in the past, it seems clear to be that your policies are very poorly configured.  I assume your business is doing extremely well, and you feel you don't have to invest in customer service.  So be it.",

I'd decided on a different solar company but one detail was a deal breaker and since Vivint was the runner up, I went with Vivint and I have not regretted it.  I have also observed that, progressively, the company is really becoming more customer focused with our online account data about how much my solar system is producing daily, weekly, monthly.  Seems they are responding to our needs. \\\\The solar system itself is working beautifully.  I do not regret going solar.  I truly am saving on my utility bills.  I had to do something and I'm so happy that this was an option.  I do recommend this company.  Trust me, I did my research, looked at lots of reviews of all the companies, combed the contracts and this was the best deal on the market.  There are hidden costs in some of the contracts they don't expect you to read, but I am one of those really detailed oriented types of persons.  They particular thing that I discovered between the final two, Vivint and another I can't even remember now, is that should you have to remove the solar panels to, say, get a new roof or make repairs, Vivint charges just $299 to remove and reattach.  The other contender charged an enormous amount per panel which added up to over $5000 just to remove and reattach.  Deal breaker...in the contract.  If that day comes, and it really could, the difference is worthy of taking note of.  Oooooh how painful that would be to have to shell out $5000 for the removal and reattachment, plus the price of a roof!  Go Vivint.  They're the best out there!",

This may be nothing to many people, but I'm very against credit cards and I like to keep my accounts very secure.  You can tell me how much you care about security, but I have paid millions of $ in bills through the years in my own way.  I wish she had been up front with me, or I possibly didn't understand what I was told, but I wouldn't have accepted it - I wouldn't have signed up, that's just how strongly I feel about this.

I\u2019ve actually paid more this last year to your company combined with my trueup bill than I\u2019ve ever paid PG&E by itself. It has been a true disappointment and looking for a way out of this nightmare!!",

            "My system has only been up for a few years and it has been out of commission for longer than it has been working. There have been NUMEROUS scheduled tech calls that are ALWAYS cancelled for some sort of emergency the tech has. I'm assuming Vivint just doesnt have enough techs on the road in the Cape Cod area. I call and no one knows what is happening. It takes MONTHS to reschedule and the entire time I miss the solar energy that I am supposed to be saving money on. I 110% hate this company, it's service team, customer service departments and everything it stands for. I have seen the trucks in my neighborhood and afterwards ALWAYS go over to my neighbors and explain my experience with your company. End result you have not obtained ONE new customer in my area. I have never had such horrible service in my life. I was told that I would be given a credit for all my DOWN time. I am still waiting to see that. It was a new system, why did it keep breaking is my first question, second question why so many cancelattions, third question customer service calls last almost an hour every single time and finally reschedulling always took at least a month out to get someone to try to fix the issues. Never again!!!!",

So, we referred our neighbors, and they had their panels installed in November. They put our names down as us who referred them, and I tried to contact our salesman to ask about it, and we've heard nothing back. We'd really like our referral bonus! Also, when our loan was processed, our payment withdrawal date was put as the 2nd rather than the 20th. When I called Mosaic to see if it could be changed to what we requested, I was told they didn't have the ability to do so, and we were out of luck. So, we've been a little disappointed lately. We like our solar panels, just the follow through service hasn't been great. I'd love some answers! Thanks!",

I have dealt with over a dozen people from Vivint who are clueless as to my situation (apparently zero communication). Your last guy came out here Jan 26, flipped my partially installed panels on, and I had to yell at him about the open circuits on the roof that Vivint left there, and told me not to flip the switch unless directed to do so. He had no idea of my situation! He promised to tell the home office and I should hear back soon. 2 more weeks later, no contact, just this worthless survey. I have paid for 7 months of electricity production, and generated NONE. I have had to pay MORE to my local utility because they are the only ones supplying me with electric. An estimated guess on how much this has cost me, would be approaching $2,000 (not counting time taken from being at work). I should have filed a claim for the basement damage costs incurred from your original poorly engineered installation, but I did not want to get into a pissing match with Vivint, because I wanted my problem fixed right away. I am truly regretting that decision, along with the decision to even use Vivint altogether. If Vivint cannot resolve this problem soon, and make good on the money that they have cost me, I may have to seek legal counsel. I have more than cooperated, time for Vivint to step up and become a standup, legit business. Call me! E-mail for a quicker response (jahowar@yahoo.com)",

Nothing - no response.  My credit now has too many dings on it - three I didnt authorize, my SDGE bills are too high because SDGE doesnt show the same solar energy KWH as you do. One support rep chatted with me a few weeks ago and was going to look into these issues but I have never heard back.

            "The most disappointing event/experience was when our system was off the grid and we were charged more by Vivnt and Hawaiian Electric.  Although there was no apparent problems regarding the modem I was not completely satisfied with the resolution.  The technicians that have visited our home to make any correction or repair our system have been very knowledgeable and helpful in resolving or at least work on the issues with our system.  However, the phone contacts I have had to make from 2015 to this year 2018 have been quite extensive.  I hope you can view our file to see what has transpired.  I do hope that in the future a better communication system can be rebuilt so that we can better resolve the issues that I have incurred with Vivint and myself.  i.e. is it the system? A modem problem? Is our system dated?  I have encountered all of these issues.  I have also received an email that was sent to me regarding the explanation of how the systems works and why and how my rates go up to due Hawaiian electrics issues.  I DO HOPE THAT I HEAR BACK FROM VIVNT.",

The transfer department is not ready to do business: the nature of that department should be ready and equipped to handle last minute urgent requests put upon the seller from the buyers' mortgage company. The department's inability to assist me, to simply sign and return a document in time, will prevent me from closing on time, affecting the closing of my purchase as well.

Our true up was about what we thought it would be last August and will be much less this year due to a mild winter in terms of temperature.  We receive our bills online and pay online as well.  Our solar panels are obviously working.  We do want to check them to make certain they are ready for the hot summer months and not dusty at this point in time.  We check  the PG&E bill each month and look at the usage as well to determine how much more electricity we use than what we are producing...it will be good to have year 2 ending July 30th, so will get our True up in August from PG&E and compare now over 2 years of usage.

We had a number of issues where the panels were not working properly and calling in to get this remedied resulted in extremely lengthy phone calls.  As a result, our solar did not get set up until after the summer and we lost most of the sun for the year.  I had to take multiple days off work for multiple inspections, at a personal detriment to my employment. We did eventually receive compensation from Vivint in the form of credit, which was nice, and the service has been mostly fine since, but given how arduous the process was I'm not really sure I can recommend to anyone.",

Now they are stuck with paying more for electricity then going with the local electric company. This mater has still not been taken care of and several complaints have been made to the better business bureau. Then when it was time to remove the solar panels so the roofing company could place a new roof it took forever for your company to set a time. Now that we don\u2019t want the solar panel to be replaced we find we would have to pay $50000 to get out of a contract that was fraudulently signed by my mom without my permission. The biggest thing is that VIVANT doesn\u2019t even have an office in Hawaii. VIVANT has only given myself and my family headaches and wish we never did business with VIVANT.",

            "I signed up at least 6 months ago for our second installation of panels in the front on my house. My husband received one call to tell him they were coming to put in the grounding rod. They came a day late and then the following day someone from Vivint called to ask us if the grounding rod was installed. I didn\u2019t realize it was my job to check if the grounding rod was installed. We made our concerns known to Serg that our snow guards were never installed on our back panels, but yet they completed the snow guards on our neighbors adjoining townhouse  two years ago. They told us at the time they didn\u2019t have enough materials to do ours. The snow falling off our roof crushed our patio table and almost injured my grandchild. This was a necessity! After the next conversation with someone from Vivint I told them again that the snow guards had to be installed on the original panels before the next installation takes place. He assured me he would check into it and get right back to me.......that was months ago. My neighbor has had her second installation completed and is up and running and we are still waiting. Keep in mind Serg completed our paper work the same day he did my neighbors. After being promised that the snow would be installed on the first set of panels from years ago,  we are so disappointed that even that has not been completed. We signed up again in good faith and were promised the world to no avail. Serg said we would also get a check in eight weeks for $700, which was a rebate they were offering at the time and again we did not receive anything. My neighbor said she was often contacted by email, which would of been another good way for you to contact us as well, since I did provide all of that information. Dina Kenney",

The sales representative apologized and promised a gift card for my trouble but he never sent it. My husband then had to take a day off for the installation.\\\\Recently we needed a new roof. I had to prove that we were told that a removal for roof repairs would cost $500. After delaying the roof repair for 3 weeks we finally got the ok. My husband waited all day for the reinstall, when he called the office they said it had to be rescheduled. So once again no show and no call. They claimed they called but we had no messages or missed calls on our phones.\\\\ I also warn my friends that even though the sales representative will say that the panels are transferable if you sell the house, what he doesn\u2019t tell you is that the new owners can refuse and you must pay off the contract. This should be explained clearly. \\ If this survey is about the removal and reinstall then you are too early because the reinstall isn\u2019t until August 30th, 8 weeks after the removal. Way too long which tells me you don\u2019t have enough crews to service your customers.",

            "Well for starters, Vivint lied to me,...and now Vivint is screwing me.  Let me explain.  It all began when I decided to look into solar for my house.  I wanted to reduce my PG&E bill and utility expenses.  Door to door scumbag, who came to the door, promised that he could reduce my monthly expenditure from an average of $125 per month, down to about $65 a month.  That sounded pretty good.  That's where the B.S. started.  I had the system installed, and my PG&E bill didn't drop.  It actually went up, to $178.  I called Vivint customer service and the response I got was \"Oh, well, thanks for calling and letting us know.\"  I didn't even get a half-hearted apology.  Your customer service training needs serious training.  Their skills are lacking, but I'm guessing Vivint doesn't pay them much so you get what you pay for.  Then I started getting the Vivint bills.  The PG&E bills dropped to about $11 a month,...sometimes $20 in the winter, but I was getting a $157 Vivint bill.  Do the math.  Does that sound like Vivint reduced my utility expense?  Oh it gets better.  Once a year, now, I get a \"TrueUp\" bill from PG&E,...$620.  Seriously, does that sound like I've saved any money in the last two years with Vivint.  Are you familiar with Implied Warranty of Merchantability?  I'll wait for you to look it up and get back to me.  When you contact me, you can explain to me how you might feel if someone lied to you and  cost you an additional $1,000 a year.  Funny thing is I'm gearing up to put a new roof on the house.  I hear there are several roofing companies that also do solar, and their customers are pretty happy with their product and their service.  If you experienced what I have,...would you recommend Vivint?",

So, your service rep, Vanessa Hodges was AMAZING, she was diligent, and made sure Vivint lived up to its promises.  Had it not been for Vanessa Hodges I would have followed through with complaints to the city, county, and BBB, working to get your permits to do business revoked.  Will all of the errors and failed inspections I do not think it would have been that difficult to at least have the city review Vivint's competency to conduct business.  Then I would have followed up on a call I received from a group claiming to be filing multiple criminal filings with DA's offices.  Once again though, thanks to Vanessa Hodges diligence and efforts to make things right I was not pushed in that direction.  Now we shall see, in time, if other claims about Vivint are true, roof damage and exorbitant bills around the one year mark.  So while an 8 is generous I would recommend Vivint with two primary warnings; you made need to do a lot of work to get them to follow through, and check back with me in one to see how the billing is going.",

I'm not happy that I was never informed about this.\\So with my Rental of the Panels and the Electrical bill I pay way more than before. Over $150.00 Per month before Solar panels I was paying gas & electric $80.00 or less. So no savings at all for us.\\I wonder if you can come to removed them? with out Charging us an Eye and A leg.\\If so please call me 831-261-4122 if not don't bother .",

Plus, panels don't produce enough most months, so you end up doubling your bill between Vivint and your local utility company.  Also, your customer service department is horrible, they are nice when you can actually get ahold of someone, but being ignored and waiting for a call back from a manager should not take more then 6 months!  I truly understand why the State of NM's Attorney General filled a lawsuit with your company.",

He told me and my realtor that the solar system would add $40,000.00 to $50,000.00 value to the price of my house.  THIS IS NOT TRUE!!!!  The appraiser will only give around $8,000.00 for the system.  In talking to other realtors who have tried to sell houses with solar, it is very difficult in this area unless the loan is paid off.  The tax credit does me no good as it took almost a year to get it installed and I had to pay of $700.00 because the system was quoted wrong.  This has caused me tremendous pressure and Camillo has been no help.  In fact he has blocked me from sending me4 him any emails.",

My installation was horrendous, unacceptable, and had to be redone. The re-do was never finished (there is painting that still needs to be done. It's been about 4 years with no progress on that.) After the panels dropped an avalanche of snow onto my deck, Vivint paid for the damages and promised snow guards, which were never installed. Every time I interact with someone, they are gone by the time I try to contact them again. Customer service is frustrating and issues get nowhere. I would advise anyone to steer clear of Vivint.  The only bright spot in my experience has been Chrissy DeWitte. Even though she is a helpless administrative assistant with little power to get anything done, she has advocated for me on multiple occasions. Recently, I've just given up on vivint fulfilling any of their promises to me. Very, very sorry that I ever got myself into this mess.",

I called various times during installation explaining how horrible it was for me, and all i received were \"i'm sorry, sir\". I believe in the idea of solar, but I am second guessing using vivint as my provider. I feel like i dont know how to verify if the panels are producing near capacity and i'm nervous for the day they produce below expected performance and i have to pay out of pocket for it. I am reluctant to call because my calling experiences have been poor.\\Please be straight up with you costumers. \"I'm sorry\" isn't an explanation for why installation took weeks and different crew, with out heads up (when i specifically asked for it) and causing me to get off of work. The only thing that allowed for me to actually get the panels installed was my having a doorbell camera. Luckily I was able to tell when the techs arrived. otherwise i would literally have had no idea. Again, I wanted solar but am second guessing my choice of vivint...",

            "When I was introduced to solar from the sales person at my house to my experience haven\u2019t been the same. My monthly bill roughly about the same as I was paying before the solar. My original goal was to get a bigger system so I can have a lot of energy banked for the winter months and it\u2019s not even providing that. I am not only dealing with the cost aspect but I have been dealing with pigeons living under my solars for the time I had them. Cost me a lot of money to try to keep pigeons off of my roof but i still have that issue. I called and try to get some assistance from Vivint and I was told that\u2019s not you guys is responsibility. Me being new to the state and ew to solar I didn\u2019t know that pigeons could of been my biggest headache. So with the customer service I have received after I signed the contract was not up to par. I reached out to your team for help and assistance and I was transferred and pushed around for about a month and I gave up after that. I will not recommend solar to anyone. It is not worth it, I won\u2019t recommend your company to anyone cause of the customer service was horrible. I work for Amazon and I am the southwest regional manager for 3PL and to stay in business customer service is paramount for us and I compare what I do for customers on a daily to how I was ignored and moved around regarding my issues at your company. I wouldn\u2019t come back to your services in the near future. Thank you for the survey. I appreciate it.",

I have had to call several times when I NOTICED LOW PERFORMANCE.  When calling in, the rep looks at the system and usual statement is \"looks like some panel are not producing.  we will send someone out\"  Well, that takes at least 30 days to get someone to come.  Then I'm told the Micro Inverters are bad on some panels.  I ask what causes that and am told probably extreme heat!  Why in the hell would you use something that can't take the hot California sun?  I wish I could have this ripped off my roof and I would go with a competitor.  For the past 2 years, I have lost the most productive solar producing months because of poor performance and the time it takes Vivint to get technicians out to fix it.  Now, we get to winter months and low production.  I am just fed up with Vivint.  Unfortunately, some of my neighbors recently had Vivint solar installed before I could tell them NOT TO USE Vivint.    I will probably not get a response from Vivint.  I have sent comments in the past and it gets nothing resolved.",

For two yrsn roughly we were not notified that our monthly power use was estimated. Due to the send and recieve unit was not operating.  Guestimations,  once we found out thru a friend due to her same situation , we called. Months after then it was done by phone thru me. Realizing a technician had to be sent out. Another thing there was at that time a $200.00 referral payout was never recieved Mr and Mrs Munzo across from me had the system installed. Be nice to have gotten $200.00 would still except it.  So a bit dissapointed on scott whitings technique in sellers ng. Disappointed in computer and tech non notification of no signal reading. Last the no recieving of $200.00 for refferal.",

I relied on Vivant to assess whether or not My home was a suitable candidate for the placement of solar panels, and of course seeing a big ticket sale only, you assured me it was.  I trusted Vivant.  You decided to place all 24 panels on my garage roof which has a significant forward sloped roof and now every time it snows mounds of snow come cascading off my roof piling up directly in front of my garage doors blocking any chance of exiting my garage unless I go out, often repeatedly, to remove it first.  I asked for help and nothing...I'm locked into a long-term contract so screw me.  Be rest assured if I had the means I would have these panels removed immediately and switch to another solar energy provider pronto.  I will also dissuade anyone from using Vivant given any chance to do so in the future.",
