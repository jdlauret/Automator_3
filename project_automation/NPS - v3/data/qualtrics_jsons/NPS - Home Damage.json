Jordan continued to check in with us as we tried to find a roofer.  He was always kind and professional, and understood our plight.

            "The onsite team, Josh Yajcaji was amazing. He did a wonderful job assessing the damage that was caused by the initial installation team and fixed our roof with great skill and professionalism. Learning that Vivint installers were once paid by the panel, it was frustrating to hear that there was 15+ misses which cause multiple leaks in our home. The only thing more frustrating, is that it took 3 damage assessments, and just over a year to have Vivint come out and fix the damage. We couldn't use one of our bedrooms because of all the black mold. Truly a horrifying experience. We kept being told, no it's not our fault, you have to get it fixed at your own expense, to... we'll take care of it and replace your roof and the interior damage. I am thankful that once the report came back that it was all caused by the install team, immediate action was taken. Maybe Vivint will learn that they need to train better. Listen better to customers. I still can't get over this all took a year to get to this point. We had 3 assessments. Again, your staff need better training. Also - communication between customer service, damages dept. is non-existent and no one takes responsibility. I spent hours on hold, because again, no one knows the answers. I think the only reason why I finally got immediate service is because I emailed the social media rep. and threatened to post my story online unless someone finally got in touch with me with some answers. I shouldn't have to reach out to your marketing department, and threaten a negative post to get action. If I were to do this all over again, I would have gone with a different company.",

To the point where he called within the 15 minutes the interior was fixed, asked me how it looked - I told him I was not home, so he said, we'll I'll call this case closed then, and to call him if I was not satisfied with the work done. Again, no communication in my file between damages and customer service. They had no idea that my panels were removed, and were double scheduling the work until I corrected them.",

Regarding another issue, I was sent an email on 11/28/2016 stating that I was going to receive a comprehensive Energy Audit.  I sent a year's worth of bills from So. Calif Edison and a spreadsheet showing my comparison from before I stated with Vivint and after.  I NEVER received the audit.  I've been pushed around from person to person; never allowed to speak to a Supervisor or Manager and on probably 15 different occasions, the rep said that I would receive a call and I NEVER RECEIVED A CALL.  I find your company to be unprofessional; inefficient and possibly fraudulent in your claims of energy savings.  I don't expect anyone to reply to my concern on this survey either.",

Then Blake said, \"We'll send the company we usually use.\"  Why didn't he just do that in the first place?  The 2nd company was the most professional I'd worked with.  It was refreshing; however, by then, I was so turned off by your company and Blake, I'm not sure I can ever recover.  I'm not recommending Vivint to anyone.",

            "Please review your records. The first rain in November after getting our solar set up we noticed little leaks all over our house and garage. After calling At that time we were told that we would get a ca'll back in regards to someone coming to look at the leaks. We NEVER got that call back. We called back after the next rain as the leaks grew. At this time we were able to set up an appointment. A couple days later a representative called from your company and cancelled that appointment. Rewind to several rains later and now January your company finally comes out to look at the roof and admits fault. Well the leaks now are even BIGGER. After my first rep telling me the roof would be completely fixes within that week and it was not I knew the road we had in front of us. Finally after many phone calls to your company because well the leaks are now bigger they finally got a roofing company to tarp our roof. Since my first rep is no longer with the company I had many conversations with rep #2. He either ignored calls or never responded to me. He also told me he was unable to get a hold of the scheduling department to get our roof fixed. Thus comes in later, but after 30 minutes on hold I was able to schedule my own appointment. April 10 2017 we were scheduled to get tarp and panels removwd, and from my understanding no one had to be home for this. Well on this day I was not home as my nephew passed away and I was with family. Come to find your workers apparently came to my house yet did nothing. And I had to find this out from the roofing company not vivint. Once again I was back to calling my rep who never liked talking to me on the phone. Only to be told he did not know why they did not remove panels but that he would get back to me with an answer. Well weeks passed and I heard nothing from my rep. Early may I call back vivint not wanting to talk to my rep but the scheduling department. This goes to my earlier comment 30 minutes on hold with scheduling I was able to accomplish more than my rep did the past 5 months and actually schedule an appointment. Sad part is the earliest appointment was 7/26 nearly 3 months later. Your company truly does not seem to take or take pride in satisfying there Customer....",

Because after waiting more than TWO MONTHS for techs to come out and fix the issues with my solar panels (which I only found out there was a problem when I called Vivint about the DASHBOARD that never works right) I still don't understand if my problem is fixed and my DASHBOARD STILL DOESN\"T WORK.  Dashboards are not that hard.  Why can't you get a working dashboard so I can at least see what my production is and get excited about it?  I actually don't think I'd recommend Vivint right now as a solar provider.  Although I give your damage satisfaction team a 10 A+ Awesome for resolving the damage (that should never have happened) in a timely manner.  The rest of your service leaves a lot to be desired.",

When we got back home and heard her messages I found that the last message she left was to advise us that if we did not respond in two days she would be closing our file. What we waited over two months to hear from her and now after several days she wants to close our file. Another problem we have had is receiving two checks for referring people to Vivint solar. The sales rep Zack told us it would be 45 days after installation before we would receive checks. It has been 4 months and no checks we have reminded Zack over and over he has said he will report it and still nothing. Wow. No I will not recommend any one else to Vivint. I would appreciate it if someone from your side will get on top of this. Thank you.",

When the painters came we were told the ceiling which was also damaged was not going to be painted. The painters were very nice but they were given between 4 and 5 hours to remove the old paint , tape , spackle and repaint. As a result of them having limited time we had to go in and redo the areas that they repaired. 5 hours is not enough time to remove old paint then tape and spackle and then apply paint.

Your techs came out to do a final install and told me in person that my service was finally back on, well he lied. My service was not back on because I was charged for another month which I wasn\u2019t suppose to because I would of had over a thousand dollar in credit if the service was truly back on. So I called and I confirmed my service was not backed on because the systems was not talking to the headquarter. How was I suppose to know that! So dissappointing at the service I have received. The tech I talked to on the phone walked me through on how to reset my system. At least she was nice. I thought I was suppose to receive a follow up call yesterday to confirm I have all the credit due to me..... nope, I did not get a call. The service and care I have received have been horrendous and I have consider calling news media outlet to have them hear my story and this nightmare I\u2019ve had dealing with and with uncaring agents who can not follow up with clients if it meant saving their lives.  I\u2019m sure they would be appalled, especially after close to a year and my service is not back on and I don\u2019t receive the credit due to me. I have been paying for close to a year of solar power which I have not been receiving. Honestly, if you we\u2019re me, would you feel like a value customer? Or would you of already talked to lawyers? Feel free to call me on my number, (408)8576953, I would like to confirm my service is back on and confirm the credit due to me and the additional reparations promised to us by serveral of your agents.

            "We have been in CONSTANT contact with Vivant solar about the continued problems with the system. YOU have failed to provide us with accurate monthly readings since we purchased this home May 15 2017. Additionally we have had multiple service calls as the system has not been accurately reporting. On one of these service calls we were informed by your technician that you have been using the incorrect model and serial number to obtain said reports which means you do not have the correct numbers. We have repeatedly requested time and time again to give us accurate readings for the month of May June July August September, October, November, and December of 2017 none of which have been provided. The system has caused a roof leak on my home one of the panels is not working and we have yet to have a technician come out and deal with these issues. You are contractually liable to provide us with accurate readings from month to month in order to properly bill us. You are in breach of your contract both from a technical standpoint and from a billing standpoint. Despite our desperate attempts to obtain the proper information and a proper working system you have failed to provide both. You cannot arbitrarily decide a a billing number without providing accurate readings. We are currently in contact with our attorney as you have not provided what you are contractually liable to provide. It is on you to resolve this issue and and give accurate readings for a system that is working properly. We have yet to receive a single monthly bill from your office that reflects kilowatts produced for any of the given month we have been here.  You were scheduled to return panels to the roof today and no one showed up after a morning confirmation call. When I called the office to find out where the guys were. I received the run around with the girl telling me she couldnt find the  man we were supposed to speak to in the building. She then transferred me to the wrong department who told me he could only reach the other guy through 'google chat' and he wasn't answering. Then he told me to call call the corporate office and request an escalation manager because no one could tell me what was going on. I called my representative in damage department and left a descriptive mesage with another associate. When my damage rep (steve) returned my call he never even bothered to call the local office to find out what happened to the crew and where they were. He offered to 'schedule' my install....which WAS ALREADY SCHEDULED FOR TODAY.  Are you kidding me?   I  have contacted my attorney and we will now head into litigation. I will not continue with this utter lack of competence, disregard for us as customers, and total lack of complying with YOUR responsibility of this contract.",

On one of these service calls we were informed by your technician that you have been using the incorrect model and serial number to obtain said reports which means you do not have the correct numbers. We have repeatedly requested time and time again to give us accurate readings for the month of May June July August September, October, November, and December of 2017 none of which have been provided. The system has caused a roof leak on my home one of the panels is not working and we have yet to have a technician come out and deal with these issues. You are contractually liable to provide us with accurate readings from month to month in order to properly bill us. You are in breach of your contract both from a technical standpoint and from a billing standpoint. Despite our desperate attempts to obtain the proper information and a proper working system you have failed to provide both. You cannot arbitrarily decide a a billing number without providing accurate readings. We are currently in contact with our attorney as you have not provided what you are contractually liable to provide. It is on you to resolve this issue and and give accurate readings for a system that is working properly. We have yet to receive a single monthly bill from your office that reflects kilowatts produced for any of the given month we have been here.  You were scheduled to return panels to the roof today and no one showed up after a morning confirmation call. When I called the office to find out where the guys were. I received the run around with the girl telling me she couldnt find the  man we were supposed to speak to in the building. She then transferred me to the wrong department who told me he could only reach the other guy through 'google chat' and he wasn't answering. Then he told me to call call the corporate office and request an escalation manager because no one could tell me what was going on. I called my representative in damage department and left a descriptive mesage with another associate. When my damage rep (steve) returned my call he never even bothered to call the local office to find out what happened to the crew and where they were. He offered to 'schedule' my install....which WAS ALREADY SCHEDULED FOR TODAY.  Are you kidding me?   I  have contacted my attorney and we will now head into litigation. I will not continue with this utter lack of competence, disregard for us as customers, and total lack of complying with YOUR responsibility of contract.",

From being told that the panels would not show as a loan on my credit and are completely transferable with the house, to being told that I if I placed as many panels on my home I would have little to no electric bill. Both of those are completely false and deceiving. When the panels were installed they destroyed my roof and even caused me to have a leak into my home. The communication to have this situation has been painful and slow. I still to this day do not have the situation rectified do to the fact that the check could not manage to make it to the contractor so now it was supposedly expedited to me and I still have not seen it. I have to go through getting everything repaired and the nightmares of working with your company all to be paying more per month for electricity with your solar. I feel scammed taken advantage of and would really just like to cut ties and never deal with your company again. You currently  have my panels so lets make a plan to do that. I will get my roof and ceiling replaced when ever I finally get the check that was supposedly expedited. At that time I would like to start the process of cutting ties with your company.

I was told there needed to be further assessment about the damage and waited for the assessor to come to the house. When he got here, he said it had already been done in the previous appointment. Then we waited for the actual repair company to come out and do the repairs. By the time the repair company got here, there was snow/ice on the roof and they couldn't do the repairs.

The appointment was for someone to come out and assess. A new appointment was scheduled, delaying the repair. It then took several weeks for the appointment to fix the leaks.  They covered the roof with a tarp, but it did not prevent leaking when it rained again.  At the same time I had Vivint coming out to replace panels.  They took the old ones off and put new ones on.  Then the damage people came out and took the new panels off to fix the roof and put them back on.  It would be nice if these type of issues could be coordinated to be done at the same time.  It would save time off from work and/or getting someone to be home for the install and damage repair.  The repair actually took a day longer than anticipated and I am still waiting for a call to let me know when they can come out and remove the debris.",

We have already had 2 different visits where it was supposedly fixed and 2 spots are STILL leaking.  The team that came out the 2nd time were great and seemed to know what they were doing.  My husband took off from work to be with them while they worked.  After a few days of rain, he noticed that 2 of the 5 spots are still leaking.  We have another visit scheduled 3/9 but my husband cannot miss another unpaid day of work to be there, so who knows if it will finally be fixed this time.  We spent A LOT of money on these panels (paid in full) and we expect better/priority treatment for leaks that could potentially lead to long term damage.  it would be nice if we could have some money back off the cost to help with the days of unpaid time off we've lost and the headache.  Until this is fixed, i can't say that i'd completely recommend your company.  Get your install teams trained better!!!",

Your company checked out my roof and said it was ok! Now rain is coming in my house and I am in no position to go ahead and replace my whole roof! I am not due for that until another 10 years! I don\u2019t know what to do about this! Aside from the roof leaks, I have had a work order in since last winter for ice blockers.

Two Vivant employees came and looked into our attic, but could not determine the source of the leaks. A contractor came in October and determined that panels needed to be removed. Over a month later, On the 25th of November, panels were removed putting the system out of commission. Vivant continued to charge us for monthly lease payments. After about a month, in January 2018 the roof was  re shingled, but no repairs to the interior ceilings was scheduled. Significant mold pollution was present in our house. Last Thursday, March 1st, 2018, the ceilings were repaired  just under 5 months after the damage was reported. Mold remediation of our heating ductwork remains to be done. Additionally, the tile floors of the three bathrooms need to be professionally cleaned to remove spilled paint and plaster residue from the repair work.",

This is causing a tremendous amount of stress and additional work as the house is currently under contract for sale and I've had to spend considerable effort finding, suspending and repairing leaks from inside the attic. Every day I must crawl in there and check the plastic for puddling and live in fear that it bleeds through the drywall in the main house. I do not blame the repairers, rather the installers of the panels were no doubt less thorough than needed.",

I want my windows replaced so that the front of my house looks like it did before the installer crashed through my window while installing the solar panels.

Our next step is having a roofer come to take the panels off and reshingle the affected areas. Then wait for Vivint to come and reinstall, which no one has confirmed the timeline or if we need to be there. Hopefully you can imagine how much time off work this is causing, not to mention the frustration and concern for permanent damage. We paid A LOT of money for these panels up front and have been very disappointed with the worksmanship. At this point only our salesperson has seemed truly concerned about our experience (David Kandel).

How is that possible?? I previously sent him pics of my damages the day I mad the initial complaint, (18 day Prior) which he swore up and down he didn't get them but when I told him I received a text message that same day that he did get them he said \"oh maybe, let me check.\" he then said that he did get them and looked at them but it seemed to me he was looking at them for the first time and he showed that he didn't really care or take the time to care to do and adequate evaluation/assessment of the situation. \\In addition to that, I when I contacted him about the contractors being done when would the solar panels be put back on, he told me I would be contacted by the team that puts them back on its been 9 days and no one has contacted me about putting the solar panels back on or if they have I have not gotten a voicemail stating such. My experience has been less then tasteful and I am contemplating if I want to continue on with Vivant or have the rest of the solar panels removed and wash my hands of this company!",

He also told us we\u2019d get a $500.00 rebate. Not only did they install panels that didn\u2019t match the existing ones but they added the second box. Upon our complaints , your solution was to remove the different panel from garage and put the newer panels on back of house. The older ones are in front of house along with the old one left on the garage! Two conduits are running from the roof now to the boxes!! It looks hideous. After speaking to Steven in Utah. I was told I signed a contract and there was nothing I could do now. However I tell everyone to never go with Vivant Solar because they lie and my house looks terrible!

I never heard from him again, it's been over a week.  Still need the repairs done.  I was disappointed in the installation crews as well.  I was told it would only take three or four hours to do the install, instead it took all day, not to mention the damage to the roof.  With the extra tiles they took off my roof, they could have repaired most of the damage they caused while they were here.   Please remedy this situation soon.

The workers who did the work were great too. All this took 1 year and 4 months to resolve. Thank u for finally getting it done.

The contractor was from NJ and I\u2019m in PA! Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think he did a good job once he had all the information, but it took too long between steps to get to the end. Which tells me that his work load is probably overwhelming at times. You guys have some issues with the sealing of these panels, and maybe you should meet with the people that do the repairs and come up with a better way of doing it! Sometimes talking to the people that actually do the job can help you gain better ideas to reduce your rework time.",

On 9/10/18 we had heavy rain and my daughters ceiling developed a huge bubble which we popped to release the pressure. A lot of water was released. The Sheetrock all around is soft and that, the wood and insulation are all covered with black mold. Therefore, my daughter has not been sleeping in there since and my husband has been made to sleep on the couch. The vivint service people came out and fixed the roof and also found that something on our meter was not working to full capacity (not sure if this effected our savings), but we desperately need the ceiling problem resolved ASAP so my daughter can go back to her own room.
