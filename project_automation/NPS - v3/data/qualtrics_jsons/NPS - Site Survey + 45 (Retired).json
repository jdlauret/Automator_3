Quality of panels questionable. You have MANY complaints on BBB. I didn't sign ANY agreement until I'd researched the panels and your business. Was not pleased so I called 7 times. Given promises you'd call back.  Didn't happen.  So, dealing with you isn't happening!  Went with another company with better quality solar panels.",

We had been visited a while back by another consultant who didn't follow through at all, and after he visited us we heard negative things ,about solar energy that made us glad he hadn't followed through.  Dan Porto listened very carefully and patiently to our concerns and proceeded to clear up the misinformation we had received and then pointed out all of the positives that solar energy, and Vivint Solar in particular, had to offer.  Then Dan gave us names and addresses of some of our neighbors as references to prove that Vivint already had happy customers right in our neighborhood which helped close the deal.  Dan is very personable and quickly gained our trust.  We needed to have our electrical panel replaced to accommodate the panels that will be installed.  Wayne Mullin and Oscar Ruiz (I believe they were from the Taunton location) were the electricians that arrived to do the electrical panel changeover.  We can't say enough about what hard workers they were.  It was an extremely hot and very humid day, but they worked non-stop from the time that they arrived and never took a break - They were here all day!!!  They finished the job and left our property spotless.  They were efficient, courteous and very friendly.  All in all we had a fantastic experience with Vivint right from the beginning and we've told many of our friends and family members about our experience.  We recommend Vivint very highly and have been telliing others to consider solar and to consider and trust Vivint when they are ready.",

            "As we stated already, Dan Porto is very professional, highly knowledgeable, friendly and quickly gained our trust.  He is definitely a people person and a very good one at that!  As a Sales Manager I believe that he would be a very positive role model and teach and encourage his sales force to be just a professional, knowledgeable and friendly as he is.  That's a win/win for Vivint and their sales force",

If one pays for and installs solar panels, what makes this economically feasible are the tax credits.  However, in my situation I pay very little in taxes in my financial situation.  Thus, the credits are of little benefit.  What was helpful to me about the Vivent proposal is that I pay no money upfront.",

Good morning Rebecca, sorry on a late response. We were on vacation last week. Well that's unfortunate. But why is one solar company saying that I do qualify and yet you say we don't? Another thing is that when the technician came over to do the measurements he forgot to do a couple of them. I received a phone call and had to set up another appointment for another technician to come out and finish the measurements only to sit at home for them to never show up. No phone call, no show up. That's to bad. Unprofessional. I'm all set with Vivintsolar. Good luck to you. Thanks for trying.  --- Chris Pawlikowski",

            "Your technician arrived and completed his survey eating 2 hours of my day.  I was later notified by my representative that he was sorry he couldn't put the solar panels in and thought I had already been notified why.  I knew nothing of why they weren't going to install it at this point and had not been notified by anyone.  It was then explained to me that I had the wrong kind of roof and that was the reason for the refusal of the installation.  The technician was up on my roof about 20 minutes after he arrived.  He came down and then had me walk him through my house as he completed a drawing of the floorplan upstairs.  If there was a problem with the installation as he came off my roof why would he waste another hour and a half sketching the upstairs floorplan?  My representative was the only one who reached out to me as of this time. I was told I was supposed to get a formal email explaining why I was refused the installation.   I understand you have rules.  The roof you refused to install the panels on is new and able to support what needs to be there.  \\\\Given that information why are you asking me how your doing if you refused to install the system?",

Trying to get a service call is nearly impossible. Promised dates are not kept and then full of excuses. My system has not been working properly since last August. It is not stable yet I am told all is fine. I track my usuage and I can tell when the system goes off line and needs rebooting . However not from your corporate office because I am told everything is fine.  I was also promised a credit for this past January lack of production . still waiting now march. but I dont expect much from your company anymore. If I had a choice I would ask you to pull your panels off my roof.",

I was just introduced to Joe because there was a possibility of expansion to my system. What a surprise to find out that he has been with you for so long. Back in August of last year when I asked if there was  a local contact the response was no. And when I called back in January and asked for Joe phone number they again did not know of him . You have got to be kidding. Not sure you guys are a legit company. Scary trust me. But Joe has been responsive and trying to help so I would hire him because he cares cant say that about anyone else that I have been in contact with within your company",

Either the roof is the wrong material (my parents) or the angle of the roof is inadequate (our home) or something else that I don't remember  (my sister), we think the solar companies would expect these problems and have ways to deal with them. My parents' roof is made with tiles and were told that the panels could not be installed on them. However, we have seen other homes with tile roofs that have solar panels. Why would another solar company be able to install them? It seems not all roofs will have the right angle, so there should be a way to correct this problem so that panels can be installed.",

He emailed a $12000.00 with $3000.00 extras for plywood to replace dry rot and new gutters and downspouts.  I am the original owner and have never had a leak.  The house is 22 years old and while there are some shiny spots there is no curling or flaking.  My next door neighbor had solar installed by you last September with no problem.  Also 4 homes around us have recently sold with no roof problems.  I understand that any roof repair is my responsibility, but when I asked if Vivint had a working relationship with a local roofer I was told no.  I was also told case closed because they could only guarantee 80% coverage. Needless to say I'm very disappointed and feel like I was left out to dry.  If a referral had been given I would have made contact asking for an appraisal of my roof and an estimate of any repairs needed.",

I just finally printed the 27 ? page document but I was told there were sections that did not apply to California customers. What? With all your resources you don't have a CA specific contract? The salesman seems to be knowledgeable but needs to step up his game. Driving a company car would also add some credibility. At present we are at least three weeks from where we could have been due to stupid delays in getting the document and printing it. This could have been avoided with just giving us the hard copy to start with!  Your competition does all of these things. You are missing the boat. I've already communicated these thoughts to the salesman. I'm not trying to be mean but I've been in sales before myself and this sales effort  just doesn't cut it. Now that I have finally printed the document, I get to spend however much time going through myself. As you might tell by now, I'm not too impressed at this point. None-the-less I'm willing to keep going down this road and my be a customer yet. Oh yes, I was at my neighbors who has one of your systems when he was on the phone to your company. Seems he was having some technical issue. He was told it might take two weeks to get a tech to his home.  Okay so this wasn't a power production issue. None the less, hearing that it would take two weeks to resolve his issue was not a positive thing to hear about your company.",

Instead, the Sales rep had me sign a form on his tablet which was for \"Insurance purposes\" only. I was never able to read what I was signing (error on my part). Once it was emailed to me , and I read what I signed, I was NOT happy since it was a Residential Power Purchase Agreement. I specifically asked, as he was leaving my house, that all I was getting was a survey. His reply was YES. I hope that this isn't a standard practice for your company. To me it is quite deceiving.",

We we're told all the equipment had to be installed on the front of the house which was not true at all.  We spoke to APS the local electrical company ane they advised the only piece of equipment required to be mounted in the front was a small meter box equipped with a quick disconnect.  I forwarded this information to the Salesman( supervisor) last week and as of today have not heard back.",

            "Initially I was told that the panels designed for my house would generate enough energy from the sun to decrease my electric bill significantly. (My electric bill was only decreased by $20.00) Now I am told that I don't have enough panels because what I have only generated 17% and they should be generating 30%. In the beginning, I was told that if later vivint found out that I needed more panels they would install them with no charge to me.  Vivint sent rep to reevaluate for more panels. I was told that I did not QUALIFY for free additional panels but I could PURCHASE additional panels in order to generate 30% (purchasing panels was my fear in the beginning but I was reassured that would not have to purchase them). I regret that I did not go with solar city because their rep's design was to cover every area that would generate the energy from the sun.  I only went with vivint because I had mistaken what my brother-in-law said. He said that he did not go with vivint  but went with solar city because they covered every area to generate the energy.  The other reason is that I was told by your rep that if I recommended them to others I would receive $200.  My son used vivint on my recommendations and I did not receive my $200. I would never recommend vivint and if I am ask I will tell them what happened to me. The panels were not installed to benefit me but installed for advertisement.  We had a very mild Winter, I used my kerosene heater and fireplace for the whole Winter, I have all new windows and new entry doors and my electric bill was still extremely high.",

I think that managers need to be able to transfer their \"best practices\" to the people they manage & Dane has a great base of best practices that he could easily transfer.  I have worked in the sales training industry since 2001.  I know how selling works & the techniques that are utilized.  It is easy for me to spot disingenuous sales techniques, but Dane has a way of personalizing the sales techniques he uses.  There are still rough edges that could be smooth out, but he's young.  He'll get there quick &  be an asset to any company's management staff.  Thank you for letting me tell you about my experience with Dane.",

She indicated that some of the construction she saw in the attic was only seen in additions (original owners no additions ever done) and she also indicated that there is always more than one access point to the attic (only one, none in garage as she claimed).  I let all of this pass at the time thinking maybe she was just verbalizing her thoughts without realizing how it sounded.  She stated this inspection was being done on her last day so not sure if it was with your company or if it was in that position.

We have just started the process, so it is hard to say whether I would recommend Vivint  or not because we have not completed the process.

Also, the rates at which I will be paying have changed a few times. I would like more clarity and consistency with that process.",

Your company charged us while we wer out of house and did not have panels and will not credit us for this .  We got half of a credit only and I can't understand why cause every customer service representative I have talked to since the beginning has no idea what they are saying and it turns out that when I talk to the next customer service representative what the other one said was wrong.   Everytime.   We wer told it would be taken. Are of then we did you get the full credit p.  It is very frustrating cause we were the ones calling and not your company to straighten things out and no one ever called us back when they promised and never would transfer us to someone who could help us. So as of now  NO I will not recommend your company and I am sorry I ever chose your company !",

However, my husband, Randy, was a consumer reporter for many years in Portland, Oregon, and is expert at finding all the questions to ask and what problems we may need to look for in sales situations like this. Chris said we were some of his hardest customers, and if he could satisfy my skeptical husband, he could help anyone understand their savings and be satisfied with the product. Chris has learned how to use spreadsheets to help figure the costs and savings and be able to have good visuals for his customers. Chris believes in your product and has had experience enough to know what he is talking about. He has a personality that connects with people. He is a good teacher about the pros and cons of purchasing the solar panels. He truely wants to please his customer and knows how to work with your other staff to get the job done with efficient timing. By the way, he has worked in enough markets now and for enough years that he has good ideas about how to streamline your processes. You would do well to take his feedback. - Linda Ripplinger",

That said, due to the delay, we don't have time to meet with anyone until after our vacation, and at that our time is thin. I asked for the price. I can save my time and the salesman. I was told he wasn't allowed to give the information until we spend our time listening to a sales pitch, essentially.  Simply put, my time is valuable. I took time out of my evening to speak to him, along with my wife.  If we cannot get a quote over the phone, to determine if we are even in a financial position to consider purchasing/financing the product, we aren't going to take our time to have to hear something that could be emailed.  Save the \"this is how things are done at Vivint\" speech.  Either you want to give yourself a shot for our business, or you don't.  There are other companies.  I don't blame the salesman, he's doing as he's been told to do by whomever he has to report to.  In a world of competition, this isn't making you stand out.",

            "Spoke with sales person walking door to door. Set up the site survey on a day that was convenient, a Saturday. Had to re schedule and was able to do that successfully via text message with my sales rep which is great. Site survey went off without a hitch and heard back within a week or 2. The communication began to degrade significantly here. I only received a text message that said the loan would not make sense. I had to request information regarding the design and the tree casting significant shade. A screenshot of the design was sent and that was essentially it. No design if I were to remove the tree, no options other than it doesn't make sense, a opinion and ultimate decision made by someone other than the homeowner.",

About a week later a technician came, evaluated our roof to see if more panels could be added, and left. I have not heard anything since. I have even contacted the sales rep because the technician left his Dewalt screw gun here and I cant even get either one of them to come back and get his tool. I wish I would have never signed up with Vivint.",

Later when I met with him again for the final sales pitch I asked and he told me it was in the mail. More than two weeks later, I have not received the gift card. He also told me that he would email me a sample contract so I could take a look before I decided. I did not receive that contract. When we repeatedly asked what happens if we move and the new owner does not want the panels, he avoided answering and just kept telling us that that wouldn't happen. When he first came, he told me that the survey of the house could be done using satellite images, but then we ended up having three men come to our house to take pictures. We were told very little about what they would be doing ahead of time. When they came the third time we didn't know they were at our house until we heard something hit the exterior of the house and looked out the window to see a long pole with a camera/sensor on the end. Every meeting since the first time the salesman came to our door has made me want to work with Vivint less and less.",

Two weeks after the initial consultation, I had to electronically resign the paperwork due to an error in the application on the part of the sales representative.  The survey technition stated there may be a problem with my electrical box but that it would be explained at the next appointment. To date I have not heard from anyone and it has been since weeks since the first appointment. I was told the whole process takes 3 - 4 months and a month has already passed and I'm not even up to the first step. Since I am getting nowhere with this company, I will be researching other options.",

However, in my opinion, the error on the application, is what might have been responsible for this long delay. Now I have not heard from him after leaving text and voice messages. I totally understand if there are extenuating circumstances preventing him from contacting me. But someone from the company should be getting back to me if he is unable to.",

I felt badly for the salesman.   Why do you have them begin the process of permits before a customer is ready to commit?   I was ready to commit to solar,  but Vivant was the only company I explored at that point.    He knew I was getting other quotes.   He  expended a lot of time and energy and didn't come up with a sale.      The other companies all came out to the house and sat down with us,  but only when we were ready to sign a contract did they start the process of the necessary permission for power company,  etc.",

He was supposed to be here on Friday at 3pm for example (after several attempts for us to get a time that worked). I told him I only had a brief window of time because I was hosting company for the weekend. By 3:15 I decided to text and find out where he was. At 3:30 he finally called and said he could be here by 3:40. I told him I didn't have the time; company was arriving by 4 (again he knew this when we scheduled). We rebooked for next week. This is at least the 3rd or 4th reschedule that's happened between the original assessments and trying to get Ben here with the data.  Not a good sign for what it would be like to work with Vivint in actually installing and managing panels.",

I had to call u to see what was up and was told no info was being sent to u guys from my system  although u were billing me every month from an estimate.  I paid more for my electricity to u and PGE then before solar. U came out to fix the issue and then I was told to call u guys in 3-4 days to see if it's working properly   again I have to call u to follow up. Not u call me the customer for follow up.  I ask why the system was not being monitored as told to me it would be when it was sold to me. I was told the common answer I get to all of the issues ...\" we have grown so large so quickly that we r under staffed but we r hiring more people\".

I cancelled the contract on April 7 2017, and sent it certified mail to your office listed on the form. I also contacted Hanna and told her I canceled the contract and she needed to send someone out to get the monitoring equipment. She did not do this and it took me over a month of calling you help line to get someone to come get you equipment. Now I am receiving emails saying I owe you money for canceling.

He checked the attic, the roof  and the electric service and said we would be hearing from the company with a plan for solar panels but we haven't been contacted. I was under the impression that it would be within a week  or so. Cameron, our very first contact, was great. My husband met with the next representative who actually did the assessment, and he was very pleased. Our son had his solar panels installed by Vivint and he's was very pleased with the whole experience. He was the one who referred us to Vivint. I hope that someone will contact us and let us know if we are or are not good candidates for solar! Thank you.",

Thanks for your review and response to my concerns and just maybe my opinion and rating can be upgraded.",

Tell me why Montgomery County received free solar vs, PG  home owners pays a larger price. ?",

He said they had applied for permits for the solar and electrical.  He made an appointment for the guys to install solar on the roof.  I took time off and stayed home.  The guys came and said they could not install the panels on the roof because the electrical box had not been replaced yet.  I sent a text letting Dan know.  I did not hear back from him.  That was a few weeks ago.  I don't know where I stand now.  I haven't heard anything.  He told me several weeks ago that they only have one electrical guy under contract and he is busy.  Well, if there isn't staff stop signing up new clients.  I feel like I signed up and was forgotten.",

Our bill is still being charged at the high rate even though the last call confirmed the reduced price in the notes for our residence. We will NEVER recommend Vivint to anyone further more we will be sharing our experience. This is clearly bait and switch as our sales rep promised us some things that were never fulfilled.

He told me to call the city and try to get them to move faster.  Turns out that when I called the city of SoJo, they told me that Vivint was notified weeks before and that your company needed to provide more information.  So, I am frustrated that weeks have gone by without any progress, and a solor rep who \"called twice weekly\" and didn't find out what took 5 minutes for me to discover.  Hoping that your company provided the needed information so we can get our system up and running.  It makes me wonder what else vivint has been hedging on.",

Once we determined Vinint failed to put enough panels on our roof to make a significant difference in our bill, years had passed. Finally have been working Chris, I believe a supervisor for our area who expedited the process only to a point. Again at a dead stop. Initially, back in 2012, I was recommending Vivint to everyone I knew and singing your praises. Fast forward to 2016 with the same issues and no progress, astronomical bills, I'm embarrassed to bring up the subject of solar. I have regrets. I've had 1 negative bill in all these years as I was promised many more..Very disappointing and whether or not we get our problems solved at this point or anytime soon, unfortunately I would not have a positive enough experience to recommend Vivint to anyone shopping for solar. Things take way too long. I've basically given up all hope anything will be resolved. Sorry I don't have anything encouraging to share.....\ud83d\ude15",

He then texted me back 2 days later and apologized for his behavior and advised that he will do everything but is waiting for approval from Corporate.

I also called him two weeks ago and he told me he was out sick and would follow up with my husband and me in a few days, but we have received no phone call. I've send him another email this morning, but if I don't hear back from him, we may walk away at this point and seek other options. We need to repair or replace our roof, but have been waiting to hear back from him about the results so we can plan accordingly, particularly since he told he we may be able to coordinate replacing our roof with the installation of the solar system to qualify for a tax credit. Unfortunately, the weather is continuing to pour out more and more rain here in Florida, so it is frustrating that he has not gotten back to us.",

Then someone came by again in Sept/October and we really got the process started. Things were moving along and we were told there was a very good chance we'd had everything going before the end of the year so we could start taking advantage of the tax credits. Everything was going well until out of nowhere we were contacted saying all of our roof/attic measurements had to be done again. We'd already started the loan process and supposedly the approval process with the county. It turns out two sales teams were working on our account. One sales person told us he was going to take over our account back in November and we've had little to no progress on our account since. The communication has been horrible since this happened and now it seems pretty guaranteed that we won't be any closer to having solar in the foreseeable future, let alone before the end of the year. This has been incredibly frustrating and makes me not want to do business with Vivint again.",

My bills over the summer were the highest they have ever been in 20 years. I feel i am paying twice for my electricity. The electric company is blaming Vivint and vivint is blaming National Grid. Had my rep come over to see what he could do. He check out bills took pictures of them to take to his office to see what they could do. In the mean time said he could put more Panels on the house. There wasn't sufficient sunlight so no panels could not go up. Didn't hear from the rep again about my situation with the bills until Vivint decide they could put the panels up but at .5 a khw more. Told him I wasn't doing that till my bill gets settled. Have never heard from him again.",

It was so stressful, as I have records of every payment I have made.  I talked to so many different agents and the story was always different.  The computer was charging people twice, I was told once.  Then, it was just a mistake and I didn't owe but then I did.  I always pay my bills.  The billing is very bad and it seems hard to talk to someone who really knows what's going on.  The only reason I ended up paying is because it seemed less of a hassle then getting a new security system, and that the system itself is excellent other then the camera hardly ever works.  On the positive side, the responses to alarms going off (by accident) are amazingly fast which makes the system all the better.  It makes me feel safe knowing that the responses are that fast.  But, if I have to encounter one more false charge then I would have to terminate as I can't afford to keep paying something I don't owe.  If it weren't for those, three, separate charges I would have rated the system a 10.  Thank You.  Happy Holidays.",

We provided a print out from our power company but would not divulge the actual payment plan. That's too invasive for a quote, if we decide to go with your company after a quote, which we understand is an estimate, we will give more information. But at this stage, your company cannot have more access than seeing our last year's numbers of energy usage for a quote. We also found it invasive that you ran a credit check this stage in the process. Again, you don't know if we plan to by outright or finance. Your Vivint rep did not stick to any deadlines and did not return calls. We met with two more Solar companies this week and will be deciding on who we get Solar with by this Friday.",

There was no pitch the was a lot of discussion give and take answered our questions honestly.  Gave us a lot of working knowledge to get us thinking. He is not a used care salesman.  He is a company representative that we believe is out to show a product that makes sense.  As a representative he has acted more as an advocate for the customer.  \\\\The site inspection fellow was just as helpful as Darrell.  My light was out in the attic and was was willing to put in a new bulb. These little things displays tons that you are here to provided a service and care about the customer.  We have have had no  feelings pressure to buy so the company can make a fast buck and fly.  \\\\My husband and I have had two emergency health concerns.  Darrell has busted his butt to make things move along with this project and make sure that we are attending to our heath issues.  Darrell has made this project a \"team effort\"  by keeping  us in the loop just as he said he would.  His companion and integrity is a rare trait in the very competitive world.",

            "My sales representative was amazing. He was very detailed and answered any and all questions I had. He also kept in constant contact with me. My other quote was Trinity. If it was based on customer interaction you would have won hands down. There were several key areas that didn't go in your favor. First off the number of panel's verses watts. You guys came in at 9.36kw with 36 panels while Trinity came in at 27 panels at 10kw. Long term 27 isn't going to fill my roof so I'll have room for expansion if down the line I decide to make a 2nd floor on my house. The 36 doesn't leave very much room to expand. In terms of watts, you guys are 260 per panel while Trinity is 290 per panel. That makes the big difference in kW.  The up front of 10 kW verses 9.36kw is a big plus for me especially for the space being taken up.  Next of course you guys have 9 more panels so you are more expensive for less kW. You are roughly 7000 dollars more which makes you monthly payment higher even though your interest rate was a little bit lower.  Side by side of the warranty's are all comparable except for the inverter. Trinity has a 12 year warranty on the inverter while you have a 10 year. Also I talked to Trinity and I am going to put the inverter on the wall in the house downstairs to really get all the life out of it. A major concern for me as well was your inverter price. I was told $115 for your inverter while Trinity was $1000 which I did a google search and they were more in Trinity's range. The $115 gave me an uneasy feeling of quality. Those were my main reasons for my decision.",

When we requested a copy of the report along with some other questions, we got no response until I emailed that we were cancelling the contract since he didn't respond to our questions. He immediately responded that he would process the cancellation but get us the responses to our questions anyway. ... And we never heard from him again.\\\\I sent in the formal documents cancelling the contract, never got any sort of confirmation from the company or from Alan. The request to fill out this survey was the first communication we've received and it makes me wonder if the cancellation was even processed.

Very horrible customer service on the phone (one woman was flat out rude and since you say the call may be monitored or recorded, I'm sure someone must have heard how this woman was acting on Vivint's behalf.  Anyway, I am mostly displeased at the misleading information I initially received regarding lowering my bill over staying with SCE.  It really did not go down that much and I was also told that at the end of the year I would owe taxes and any small overages to SCE that would amount to about $95.00.  My last end due bill from SCE was almost $500.00.  Totally unexceptable.  I even had a customer service rep take another look at what was happening as to why SCE was so much and they did another site survey.  \"Devin\" the customer service rep promised me he would get back to me with some answers and he never did.  I tried contacting him 3 months later and was ignored.  I have since removed the Vivint sign from my yard that was advertising to the neighborhood and getting lots of folks to inquire with me and have since reversed every positive thing I have said about this company and letting others know just what they can expect.  Most of which now will steer far clear!  I wish I wasn't duped by this company whom could care less for their customers now that they have taken over the electrical contract.",

I agreed to having the person come out and perform the assessment, took a few hours of my time and accompanied the gentleman to the areas he needed to access...the attic and other parts of the home, and said everything looked good to him.  I was told at the time, that the assessment could take a week or two to get the results and I would be contacted at that time and an appointment would be made.  This was told to me by your salesperson.  While I don't have exact dates, I can assure you it has been well over a month and I have not received one phone call from any staff member of your company.\\\\Having been a former senior executive for a fortune 500 company, I know what it takes to have a \"great customer experience\", and your company falls well shy of that simple, straight-forward standard.  I am definitely going to pursue solar opportunities to my home due to my environmentalist lifestyle.  The company that did my next door neighbor's home seems to have an excellent reputation in the community and I plan to speak with them in the near future.\\\\Do yourselves a favor and start \"managing the business\".

He clearly understood and repeated my expectations and said that he could provide the information I had requested. \\\\Over the next several weeks, Mr. King failed to provide the information that I had requested in writing.  Instead, Mr. King wanted to only speak by phone.  During our phone conversations, I again clearly stated my expectations in order to move forward with the purchase and installation of solar panels on my property.  Mr. King failed to provide that.  \\\\On Friday, October 14th, Mr. King called my cell phone not once, but three consecutive times.  If a person can't answer their phone on the first call, I don't see a reason why you have to call back two additional times.  I was at work and unable to take the phone call at that time.  This lack of professionalism was the last straw.  Mr. King's unwillingness to provide the information requested, along with his lack of respect and professionalism displayed toward a customer, caused me to cancel my relationship with Vivant Solar.",

            "First, I must apologize for my delay responding to your email. I rarely use this email account.\\ \\You ask me how are you (as a company) doing?  My answer is \u201cNot very well to date\u201d.\\All of your installers and sales personnel need to have a thorough understanding of your products. All of them have different interpretations of your products. The main reason my wife was interested in your system is because we were informed that our existing cameras could be integrated into your system. We already had a Ring Doorbell that worked more efficiently than yours. Our Ring doorbell responds much quicker and is adjustable, i.e. zooms and can pivot up to 45 degrees left, right, up, and down.\\ \\We also already had a NEST.   We received by the installers (3 of them) and salesperson various versions of your system's functions, benefits, and features. The salesperson and the first two installers said either yes to all of our concerns or \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. The last installer gave us the news that the cameras that we have are not compatible with your system and that none of your cameras can be placed outside higher than arm\u2019s length (without a ladder). By the time we realize just how different your system is from what we initially thought we were getting, it was too late. Our old system had been removed and now we are making do with your system.\\ \\So, to answer your question, we are not happy with your system at this point. Please copy (cc) your response or comments to this email address: yknotu2me@yahoo.com\\ \\Gary & Tess\\ \\ \\ \\Gary S. Smith\\SEPTA Rail Control Center Manager\\1234 Market Street 19th Floor\\Philadelphia PA 19107\\gssmith@septa.org",

Another crew showed up 2-3 weeks ago took measurements , haven't heard from them since. Salesman called to see how things are going . I told him he said he'd look into it haven't heard from him since.   He did text me and stated they MIGHT be able to come out this week or weekend to fix, I told him during the week between 11:30 and 1:30 during my break would work out great for me. haven't got any reply since. I can't afford to take anymore time off from work . I had taken a weeks vacation for the time the installation was suppose to happen .

We missed the initial surveytime, and didn't hear back from them, so I called and rescheduled.  They came and did the home survey.  Two months later, I still don't have a quote.  I've been calling and e-mailing the sales guy and he says they are just to busy.  A month ago I had a visit from SolarCity and got their quote and home survey.  I told the Vivint salesman that I wanted to wait for vivints quote since they came first.  Weeks later, and I still have nothing from Vivint....except an e-mail wanting my feedback.  Nice saleman, good pitch, terrible follow-up, and non-existant closing, which is why I'm going to sign up with solarcity.",

I proactively contacted him to see where we were at about 3 weeks ago and since then radio silence again.  I would love someone to tell me where things are at but at this stage I have zero confidence in the company or process.  This sales rep actually sought us out as well and did a random drop by based on where our house was, the direction it faced, and the amount of availability we had so I question how bad your company really wants our business.  Overall following the initial appointment the service and follow through has been beyond disappointing.  If someone else wants to pick up the project please have them call me.  If not you can assume that I have moved on with my business to one of your competitors.",

Not from the salesman or anyone from the company.  Since I just received this survey, I will blog to everyone interested in  going solar to stay away from your company.  Since I am a retired attorney, I will do whatever it takes to make sure everyone in the Rio Rancho and Albuquerque market knows what a sham your company is.  Vivant may think it is alright to waste people's valuable time but frankly, this is one of the worst companies I have ever tried to do business with.\\\\I hope this answers your question about how I \"like my solar experience\" with Vivant.
