I was transferred between billing dept and transfers department too many times to count. I told everyone I spoke to that my account is set up for auto pay and that I will pay my bill on time. However I continued to receive a phone call and an email every other day. I had to block vivints phone number from calling me. And a Vivint rep showed up to our house twice offering to upgrade our house to be a smart home...even though we told them we weren't interested on their first visit, and even though we have a no soliciting sign. The solar panels are wonderful. That's the only reason I would recommend vivint. However, the interactions I've had with the representatives so far have been horrible.

            "What's missing is human beings actually having the authority to help. I was told that although I had not been sent a statement, I was going to continue to receive daily phone calls and emails saying I had a past due balance. I started receiving these calls only 3 days after we closed on our house stating that we had a past due balance. I made multiple calls asking for a bill or statement showing that we owe and then we would (and finally did, 2 weeks later) gladly pay, to which the answer given (from the billing department of all places) was that they cant access statements and its all automated and outside of their control. I now firmly believe that Vivint has abandoned running a legitimate and honest operation by hollowing out actual humans doing actual work for actual customers , and replaced them with an automated bureaucracy of computer code that cannot and will not be able to actually provide a good experience. Your business model sucks, and you probably dont care because it saves you costs in labor. Im using the solar because the house I bought had a preexisting solar lease on it. Otherwise, I would immediately look to find another service, as you have so far failed in every way. Even my account right now has still not been updated to give me information about my array.

Given that, my \"billing specialist\" flatly acknowledged that what was happening to me shouldnt be happening, but essentially said too bad so sad and tried to pretend like it wasnt an issue. No doubt, he probably deals with this stuff all day so I would probably become jaded too, but how can you call someone's title \"billing specialist\" when they have zero authority to actually help with billing?!? Listen to the recording and see for yourself, I will gladly accept fault if you can show me my error.",

When we get credit from UI, it is at .04 cents.  Certainly seem like you are doing great selling our extra to them.  I a getting screwed and my husband and I are no longer speaking since it was all my idea.  I have since warned y B-in-Law NOT to go with your company.  I should have struck a better bargain with you, but never expected such a nice man as Josh to take advantage of a 70-year-old retiree. Can you help me understand ow this happened and maybe how I can get more money for the energy we produce and do not use.",

After calling back a couple of times and asking for the names of people I had talked with, I was told the names of the people I was given do not work at Vivint.  I used the same phone number each time.  I eventually got satisfaction a day or two after.  Meanwhile, VIVINT got my credit card number for payment within 3 minutes of the first call.

            "With this current experience, absolutely nothing.  My issue began when a friend recommended Vivant and we called to inquire about the company based on his recommendation.\\During the sales presentation, we specifically asked, although at the time we were not considering selling our house, what would happen if we did decide to sell and the buyer did not want the solar equipment.\\While I'm sure it was  in the fine print somewhere, the sales representative told us that it would not be a problem, that Vivant would simply come and remove the equipment.  What he failed to mention was the cost involved in buying out the contract in the event a buyer did not want the service.  He said, \"who wouldn't want to save money by having solar?\"  \\We agreed with that statement and thinking and believing that if we ever did sell, the equipment would be taken over by the buyer, or removed (thinking there would no be a charge to do so).\\Well we were wrong on all counts.  Our circumstances did change and we marketed the house with the thought that the buyer would assume the service.  \\Long story short, the buyer was very shrewd.  When he asked questions about expanding the number of panels on the roof for some project he had planned for the property, he was apparently convinced he didn't want the service.  \\Then came our culture shock.  It only cost us about $22,000.00 dollars to buy out our \"contract\" and leave the equipment in place on the house.  We felt a bit betrayed and feel that the sales person representing your company was not totally honest and forthcoming when asked questions specific to the removal of the equipment.\\The reason we had recent contact with your billing department is equally confusing.  The property where the equipment is in use has been resold, advertising the fact the  home included \"paid for solar\".  If it was paid for, why are we getting notification.  Are we due some form of indemnification or rebate payment or proceeds from the new sale as we are obviously still involved in someway with the property, and your company.  Please advise.\\\\Thank you.",

            "I was disappointed to learn that having solar on our home is going to make our home difficult to sell.  When we first had solar installed, we were not planning to move.  However, a great opportunity presented itself, and we could not turn down that opportunity.  When we consulted with a Vivint representative while deciding whether or no to get solar, we were assured that we could relocate the system and continue leasing from Vivint if we ever moved.  When I called recently, however, I was told that option was not on our contract.  Now we have buyers who are interested in our house, but they are reluctant to take over our $160/month lease.  We have a very large system because we use quite a bit of electricity to keep our house cool.  I realize that most people would not need as much electricity, and could have a much smaller system, but there is no option for them to downgrade for a lower price, either.  While the representatives were helpful and did answer my questions, I felt like we were misled when we decided to get the system, in the first place.",

            "A great deal is MISSING from Vivint!  I\u2019m a senior citizen on a fixed income and like many of us were looking to keep our expenses in check.  Your sale repre James Kunz promised me a great deal from you company and most important, big savings!  I was assured of saving at least 50% on my electric bill and I\u2019m maybe saving $100.00 and not half to three quarters of the electric bill.  James also told me Vivint would keep the panels in good condition by cleaning them.  I called to ask when they could get cleaned and I was told it was up to me.  All I would have to do is get on the roof and wash them or hire someone to do the job!  I\u2019m 73 years of age and climbing on the roof does not sound very smart.  To hire someone to clean cost money!  In addition, some of the tiles were damaged when the installation took place.  I complained and some supposedly came and corrected the damage, but I was not at home as I asked to be when they were replaced, instead I received a text telling me it had been done.  My bigger upset came from James by all the \u201cpromises\u201d made to me!  I feel\\as though I was seduced by the promise of saving a great deal of money!  Later, after the installation I was told that the cost of kilowatts was subject to increased.  Now, I\u2019m stuck with Vivint for 20 years or if I buy you out at the tune of $20,000.00 and who knows, it\u2019ll probably be more if ever I would be in a position to buy the system.  Every single time I call to pay, I  get infuriated by feeling like a fool for falling into James\u2019 seduction of \u201chave I got a deal for you!\u201d.   To make things worse, I have a contract with you not easy to read or understand!  I am sorry that I signed a contract with James and with Vivint!",

Shame on you Vivint Solar for not being honest!  I was recently asked if I would recommend Vivint.  I had to honestly say no, as you were not honest in how I was told I would be billed and how you now insist on billing me.  I had problems with installation as well.  It was late being installed, Vivint messed up with the installation and had to come back to bring it up to code and then when it was supposed to turn on there were issues.

The leak is becoming flashing was put on one connection by solar. The roofers didn\u2019t come now both of these people didn\u2019t call me. I called them to find out where they were. After waiting 3-4 hours for them to show up. I work nights so this ment they took my sleep time and wasted it. I\u2019m very disappointed in the response I get from the employees",

            "Actually following through on these surveys would be a good start.  I've completed many and they go nowhere.  Calling in, spending over 1 hour and being transferred multiple times for simple transactions is ridiculous.  Too many different departments and employees don't have much authority to handle customer inquiry.  I was assigned a manager for my case over a week ago and I'm still waiting for a response.  My account is currently screwed up because monthly charges were deducted from a specific service I was told I needed to pay for in advance.  Contract benefits Vivint and forces customers to deal with the bullshit or pay hefty cost to server the relationship and go elsewhere.  Choosing Vivint was one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made as a homeowner and I wish I could undo it.  Not expecting and response and it won't be the first time my survey response is ignored, which is typical Vivint style.  Poor customer service!!!",

The card is also used for autopay for several other bills such as cable/internet and cell phone service. Those other companies simply contacted me and requested the new card information in anticipation of the expiration in August 2018. Vivint simply contacted me and claimed my account was past due. After talking with the Vivint representative we determined that it was just a matter of updating the card information rather than accusing me as the customer of being delinquent with my payments. In fact, the card on file is still in effect until August 2018, so there shouldn't have been a problem with the July payment. In my opinion, Vivint needs work on the customer service side.",

I'd recommend to any of my friends that they look into Vivint, but I'd also have to tell them to comparison-shop. How could I say \"10\" when I have no idea what else is out there?\\\\2. The emails keep addressing me as Douglas, even though Vivint has literally only ever had contact with me (Karin). Is it because boys usually take care of the billing and someone assumed? Probably not. It's probably because some poor soul was typing hundreds of names into hundreds of boxes and his came first. It doesn't really matter, but it still irritates me a tiny, tiny bit.\\\\That being said, I said 7 rather than 5 because my experience has been pretty positive and I have nothing bad to say. Do I wish that the previous owner had bought solar panels instead of renting them? YES, but oh well, both me and Vivint are benefitting from this arrangement, and it's fine.",

They\u2019ve recently offered to add more panels but given the track record I\u2019m highly reluctant to enter into a new 20 contract with you or recommend anyone else to as well. I have to admit, when we first installed, I was singing your praises anticipating the relief to high bills. It didn\u2019t take long for me to see the light.

It took another 3 to 4 weeks  to determine whether or not I was going to get my money back I then had to call to get my refund submitted and if I had not given my banking information it would have taken another four to six weeks before I will receive a check in the mail. The process was terrible and need to be fixed immediately Vivint customer service appears that they do not know what's going on and everyone wants to transfer your around. I will not do Vivint solar nor will I recommend you...I choose 5 only because everyone needs their job and base on my experience I selected the middle ground because it's not the agent it's \"Vivint\" policies.",

I have been told several times I will get paper statements in the mail. That had not ever happened either!!! The last call I was told that I would not get paper statements because I have an email address. However over the past 10 months I only received a statement in my email twice.  I then either am late or have to waste time calling to get my balance. It is extremely annoying!!! One of your customer service reps was also extremely rude about stating you are a paperless company after the person before her said that I would get mailed statements ! \\I informed her to let her supervisors know that I would love to pay my bill on time but I can not do that IF I DONT GET THE STATEMENTS!!",

Apparently you tried to use my old account to make a payment. When that didn't work, I kept getting emails and phone calls. I'd check my account and it was showing the balance was zero. I finally called to see what was going on. The agent was rude I felt. I told him that I had updated the account. For some reason, it wouldn't let me delete the original account, so there were two accounts listed. He said I'd need to make a one-time payment now. I didn't understand it since you had had the new account for at least a few weeks. When i questioned him, he was very sarcastic and rude to me. I told him I thought he was acting sarcastic to me. He never apologized. Didn't explain why i was showing a zero balance. Left me perturbed. Overall I have had good experiences with Vivint. But last fall when someone needed to come to the house, I had to take hours off of work to do it. Then he never showed up. I just don't understand how that can happen.

These kind of tactics are the kind of tactics that companies use on elderly people to confuse them and take their money. The associate kept on saying he would put a note in my file that I was refusing payment. I was not refusing payment. I was simply asking to be sent an email of the bill and I would pay it. I do not give my credit card number to people who call soliciting money. Sounds crazy right? (I hope you understand my sarcasm there.) This associate then proceeded to tell me I was two months of payments behind. That is false information. Yesterday was the 16th. My next bill is not due until the 20th. This was just another example of your companies bullying tactics. I asked to speak with a representative from a management level and he stated that he was a manager. It appears that this gentlemen needs remedial training on customer service. It is unfortunate that this individual performed his job the way he did. I have had great experiences in the past with other employees of your company.  I thank you for taking your time to read my complaint and I look forward to receiving my bill so I can pay it.",

Where are my savings? I so regret getting talket into getting them. If I find a way out of this mess I would.   Your customer service reps have no answers explanations for me or assiting me in any way. Im not the only one dissatisfied. my neighbors are just as fustrated and angry.  So far you have not provided any savings or support for me as promised. Unless you can find a solution to this problem We will have no obtions then to contact our Attorney. I know you have many lawsuits pending for good reasons. I would prefer not to go thru litigations which can be expensive for both of us. Please contact me if you want to resolve my problem. I do not want to discuss this with a customerservice rep. Thank you. Marita Forsythe",

It is now July 20th and my issue that I initaly called about, has still not been resolved!! Your customer service is unreliable, dishonest, and can\u2019t keep a straight story to save their lives! A customer should not have to call this many times to get their bill that (YOU) Vivint messed up, resulting in a bill OVER $1,000. By me calling and being persistent over the past month, I was approved a compensation in the amount of $884 to my account. I was told by 3 customer service reps, that my compensation has been Expidited and approved on June 26th!!!!! However, till this day, it still has NOT been credited to my Vivint solar account. I don\u2019t know what else to do to speed this along. Every time I call to get an update on the issue, I get told a different story and to basically wait because it\u2019s still in progress. This is just ridiculous and uncalled for! I am demanding a call from a manager of authority!! Since you say you read all these comments.... I\u2019m expecting this to be read fully and a follow up call to me is highly expected, if you want to keep a relationship with your customer!",

            "Every time I try paying my bill, it\u2019s a disappointing confusing experience.  When I log in to the Vivint website, the balance always says $0 due.  So I am forced to call and pay over the phone.  It seems to confuse the customer service representative that I want to pay via phone.  Eventually when they are able to help, they are very nice and helpful.  Just getting to that point is a challenge...  every time.   I refuse to start an auto pay because I manage my money a certain way and is not convenient for me.  If I were to just get a paper bill in the mail each month, it would be extremely easy to get paid on time and I could see the billing activity.  The website sucks and is a challenge to navigate just to get to the place where I see what I owe.  Then I\u2019m unsure of what month I am actually paying for..  additionally it\u2019s overly confusing how Vivint bills and I feel I wasn\u2019t fully understanding how it all works when I signed the agreement.   It seems like I pay more than I ever did for electricity when I was just paying SCE.  I regret ever starting this deal and would not refer Vivint solar to any friends or family.  I like having solar on the roof but next time I will just eat the intial cost and buy it myself to avoid all the Unnecessary confusion.  Also the installers did not install the conduit running from the panels to the electrical box the way the engineers assured me they would..  I am left with an eyesore visible from the front of my house.  Customer service said they would have it changed, but I refused because there was already a hole cut in the roof where I didn\u2019t want it to be cut.  So instead of having a repair that looks worse than before I chose to leave it.  If they would have done what they said from the beginning it wouldn\u2019t be an issue.",

            "Mike Brand came to my house pretending to be part of SDG&E and seem very trustworthy.  I believed him and convinced me to go solar with Vivint Solar.  Claiming that all most my neighbors had gone solar with Vivint Solar.  That I was going to save a lot of money in the long run and that if that was not the case, Vivint Solar would fix it by putting more panels.  But he \"verbally\" guaranteed lowering my bill.  Truth is when I was with SDG&E I had 1 bill averaging about $50.00 per month for electric and gas.  Ever since I went with Vivint Solar my bill has doubled and I still have 2 extra bills from SDG&E for gas and electric.  I am a 56 year old woman with minimum income that was happy to be on the CARE program and Mike Brand screwed it all up.  I wish I could say better things but I am very disappointed in the way Vivint Solar is being misrepresented.  Mike Brand also promised $500. incentive for every referral. I am so glad that the friends I mentioned your company to did not go with Vivint Solar.",

The last one was to replace the WiFi communication box inside the house because the RJ45 port was broken. I check this box ever so often to ensure it is communicating. Yes, I have seen monthly statements with zero balance. Vivent has had the same account to withdrawal every month. When I called Vivint to change billing method to a new account number, Mickey in billing told me there were $602.00 back bill. That was not my problem, seems the equipment has always been the issue. I called Customer Support and they gave me a $325.00 credit. Mickey informed that would take place when I paid off the $602.00 first in thirty days. I do not have any proof that I was reaping benefits from the system. I do not mind paying for the benefits but not in a lump sums, which I totally find unfair, since you have had my account number all the time. Why didn\u2019t Vivint reach out to me before hand. I have never been late on any payments. I recently separated from my wife, so I wanted to close the account. Was told I could transfer system to new owners, suppose they do not want it. Was then told the contract buy out would be $16,000.00 and I would have to hire a contractor to remove it, and it\u2019s mine. This system was introduce by your representative as a help to save the BGE electric grid. He said that BGE needed to have 20% of its customers on solar or be fined by the State. I did not pay a penny for the system nor did I read the contract fully. I relied on your representative to tell me everything, especially about buying out contract. I personally feel that this is unfair business practice. I believe Vivint is not making any effort to fair. Thank you!",

When we talked about options, I felt her demeanor changed because I said it wasn\u2019t fair for billing practice, of paying $602.00 in 30 days, especially when you had my account number the whole time. Her tone was like \u201cwell that\u2019s just the way it is\u201d. We out any regard to what caused the back billing. Totally frustrated at this point because I surely do not have $16,000.00 at my disposal.",

NO ONE ever showed up and they have never added any more solar panels. Another thing I don't understand is that now in the summer when the sun is shining the most the bills are higher than in winter. When You came out to talk about putting the panels up I was told that WHEN the panels generated more electricity than was used that I could sell it back to the electricity company.

I questioned: on June 8, 2018, I received an email with this information- Billing date as Of June 6, payment due is $-572.47. My next email arrived July 10, 2018, Billing date as of July 9 amount due on July 20 is $87.17 AND the amount of $87.17 was taken out of my checking account on the due date. My question is the discrepancy in my billing. How can I receive and email from you with me having a credit of $500+ and the next billing I OWE $87? Did I use more than $600 worth if electricity in ONE MONTH? Hope someone in your business can enlighten me. I am NOT a happy camper. Elizabeth Brown, 808-722-4163.",

I was told that there was a bad circuit baord in the panel attached to our garage. When he left he took the white box that connects to our internet modem and said he would be back in a few days to replace the circuit board and box. It is now July 24 and I have not heard from Vivint as to when the box will be returned or a new circuit board installed. When I called on July 13 I initially called billing about our bill and then she transsferred me to another department and they transferred me to scheduling where I had to leave my phone number for a call back. Guess what!!! I am still waiting for a call from scheduleing to find out when they will be coming back. I feel that this is a breach of contract on Vivint's part and I want it corrected!!",

I could not get into the website on July 10th to see what my bill was for June so I called. When I got a person on the phone I was told that I had no bill for June and that there was a surplus of over $600 to which we decided could not be correct. As this was being looked into we checked the production for June and found that the bill should be about $175 which is about $30 more than I was told the bill would be at this time of year, which is one more false statement made at the sales point. Your people were unable fix this billing situation, that leaves me to make sure Junes payment stays in the bank until it is corrected. In addition, your billing Dept. does not send customers any notification when the money is taken like others do, so I must check the bank statement to make sure.\\ \\         William Alvord",

They returned to our house 3 times @ least & were very pushy sales that finally convinced my husband they were here to help. My husband signed under the verbal agreement trusting their word we were renting mo. We called both repeatedly to ask questions & they never returned calls. Dealing with the billing dept was another problem of questioning why we recd a bill 3 mo later, we insisted with Gilbert, Sales, he never returned calls instead called billing that we need invoice & then told we were on 20 yr contract to buy & they did not give us total information of agreement. The billing dept also said Vivintsolar did not have a Corp office we could speak to or telephone number. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE HOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE JUST TO MAKE A SALES WITHOUT A CORP OFFICE & CHARGED &5.00 For not signing up for e-mail we told them we do not know how to use. We are seniors on a fixed rate income & know we were really taken advantage. Also being charged an extra $5 for mailing to us is unheard of. We already are definitely not recommending your company when asked who did our panels & my daughter checked your really unfavorable reviews. Remember Gilbert & Joy, don\u2019t trust them!!",

I don\u2019t want to do autopay but you tell me that is the only way I can see my bill.  So shifty.  I will never ever refer your company to any person the rest of my life. I will only have negative things to say. Take all your panels off my house please.  I have contacted the attorney general and the cpuc and every advocate group I can to get help getting away from this contract. I can\u2019t afford to pay over 400 a month for power.

The sales rep told me I could use  my checking account debit card to pay the bill and still receive the discount he lied. Now I'm requesting a copy of my bill each month and the company says no that the contract states bills are all electronic.  However when I read the contract it doesn't say I have to have electronic bill it states that your company will supply me with the bill. So why can't one be mailed it does not say in the contract that I cannot receive a paper bill. Seems like your company uses the contract when it's to the company's benefit.

            "We just got the Solar Panels Transferred in our name because they were already on a home we purchased. We were told by the previous owner and the realtor that the solar panels would only cost $100 per month which was a lie there about $270 per month which is a rip off because Southern California Edison would be cheaper. We are only 3 people living in a 1600 Sq Ft home and are only home from 6pm-6am. We only turn our air conditioner on when we get home for a couple hours a day. So we differently don't use a lot of electricity. And also one of your technicians came out and said to my husband that the system you leased the previous owner is way to big for the house and this is why our bill is so high. I don't know who Vivant thinks they're taking advantage of but it certainly wont be my husband or I. This is a Disappointment and sounds like some one here is taking advantage of customers. I feel sorry for other residents who were promised things and lied to. We would like to re-negotiate our contract and also get some of these panels removed off our roof since we were over sold on them. \\Thanks\\Lauren Volder\\17322 Coralwood Circle\\Yorba Linda CA. 92886",

            "When I try to sign in and pay my \"overdue account\" there is no registered account under my name, and the registration tool cannot find my billing number. I contacted the billing dept about emails I keep getting saying my account is overdue. The auto-reply says to expect correspondance in 48 business hours. First of all, why say 48 business hours? How long is that? Anyway, it's been 10 days with no response, so clearly Vivint doesn't care about it's customers even when they may owe money to the company. \\\\This is after the rocky transfer process is still trying to get off the ground. I called the transfer team June 30th to inform them of settlement and I got someone on the phone who assured me everything would move forward soon. However, the transfer team didn't follow up and when I asked two weeks later about when the tech would be coming to install the gateway device, I was told there was no transfer. So, we had to start again and schedule the tech for the end of the month. I'm hoping this one part of the business works and they show up on time. \\\\So here I am as a new customer, in the highest solar output summer months operating on \"estimated usage\" without the gateway to communicate with Vivint. How am I to know what I'm being billed for? Especially since my account has not been set up yet. But I still get those late payment emails! You would think a company interested in competing in the solar market at all can set up a new customer in a shorter time than 2 months. \\\\It's only the beginning of my relationship with Vivint, but I do not have high hopes for the future. I love the house I bought, but it's unfortunate that struggle with Vivint services was a hidden cost.",

Nicole called me at 2:54pm Arizona time on 8/14/18 and said I have a balance of the $2,000 with her to which I replied \"excuse me?\" She said \"why haven't you paid your bill?!\" In the rudest, snarkiest tone I've ever heard. I told her I owned a home with Vivint's panels on it for almost two years and sold it in July, and all of my bills were always paid on time. To which she responded \"oh yeah that closed out last month, sorry about that.\" The customer service this company has is DISGUSTING! Whoever is training these people, or lack there of, should be fired along with every single customer service employee!! We've had nothing but issues getting rid of you guys. We were considering getting panels on our new home until we tried to close out with you and transfer. I cannot believe this company is still running. I tell every single person I know about the shitty service we've gotten from you, and will continue to do so for the rest of my life. Something within this company needs to change or there won't be a Vivint Solar much longer. \\The last time I called in I explained to a genetleman what I needed, he transferred me to billing to take off my auto payment (because my house had been sold for a month) and Shelby in billing didn't even let me talk before transferring me to Transfers. After being on hold for almost 20 mins, I hung up. Called back in and immediately asked for a supervisor. The supervisor said he needed to make sure all paperwork was in for Transfers to close out before taking my auto pay off, WHICH IT WAS (AGAIN IT HAD BEEN A MONTH), and then he still couldn't take my payment off. He did direct me on how to do it myself, so kudos to him for knowing one thing. \\This company is a joke.",

I have tried for over a year to have your company to call me...sending a letter, putting notes on the payment and  calling your company, with no response!! My mother died over a year ago and no one will reply to me in regards to the contract I have questions on. For one the copy of the contract is NOT her signature. Please contact me by phone NOT email to discuss. Also the system has been unplugged for the past 3 months due to remodeling of her home. I will meet with a technician today 8-18-18 to reconnect. That is why I contacted the billing department to dispute the charges when the system is not on. We need to get the contract issue addressed asap or I will be contacting a lawyer.

At one point, my mortgage company had to get a lawyer to write a letter to get any response from your financial arm to a mortgage re-fi, of which Vivint held up the process for months due to ineotitude.  This time around, I'm approaching call #5 to get my account transferred after a house sale.  You have all the paperwork, you've acknowledged it -- you're just \"backed up\" each and every time I call, with impotent customer service people not being able to do anything of help.  No explanation as to why you keep billing me outside of the aforementioned statement.  On top of all this, the contract \"magically\" changes every time I call to get any service from the company.  \\\\In essence, Vivint is the most weasely, most inept company I've dealt with in a long, long time.  \\\\This is a shame as I intended to get solar panels on the new house, but will never do so with Vivint now, and will actively argue against business with your company to friends and family.",

Took over a year.  \\By that time SCE solar rates had changed and if the installation had been completed on time I would have been grandfathered in to the old rates.  Another is that my SCE bill has gone done, but my Vivint bill is as high if not higher than my normal monthly bill was pre solar.  So now I have to realy on SCE to send my rebate check instead of the solar company.\\Don't see any positives with Vivint.

I was informed by vivint when it was transferred to wait for a bill.  No bill came and I was told today that there are no more paper bills.  Nobody informed me of this.  Additionally, the rep could not tell me what the charge was for (how many ke, timeframe, etc). How do you send an email that a bill is past due with no statement explaining what the charges are for.  Also the vivint solar website is terrible.  You have to enroll in autopay to even see your bill.  Overall, I should not be held accountable for a past due bill when there was absolutely no notification and wasn\u2019t even informed that paper bills don\u2019t go out anymore when your rep told me to wait for the next paper bill!",

            "We had called no less than three times to inquire about our bill. We recently had the solar panels transferred into our names when we purchased our property. Representatives kept telling us we would receive a welcome packet along with details regarding our bill. Needless to say, the welcome packet never arrived and the bill never came. Finally somebody told me that I owed $42 and change, which I paid. Three days later, we were contacted by yet another billing person telling us we were in arrears and were ready to go to collections. Another $64 paid and still, no welcome packet, nor billing statements. Attempted to get email address and phone number on the account switched...took at least four calls for that to finally happen. I was finally able to get somebody scheduled to come out to the property to hook the panels up to my wireless network so that I could track performance online only to have another person call me the following day to ask if they could schedule an appointment to come out to do the same thing that I had just scheduled the day previous. You all need to train people to multitask and verify information prior to making calls that make you look incompetent. I will not recommend Vivint Solar to anybody because of this experience.

I was concerned about a safety advisory I received --something about an AC Disconnect switch.  I also need to know about cleaning the panels.  Does Vivint do that follow up service?  A young woman called me from Vivint and said the advisory was probably nothing to worry about and that the panels don't need cleaning.  She said that the rain cleans them.  I live in California!  We hardly GET any rain.  Also, the water is hard so it could make stains on the panels that might inhibit their performance were I to use a garden hose.  I'm  seventy-five.  I don't relish getting on my roof  in the hot sun to wash my panels.  I'm not happy with the lack of communication!  My recently late husband made the original contact with Vivint and I'm pretty clueless about the whole thing.  The comment, \"Oh, it should be alright.\", from your representative left me quite anxious.  I don't want to get anyone in trouble, but I have quite an investment here, and I need some help/answers.",

            "Mike, \\In speaking with you last Thursday, through a representative, you informed me that the actual bank transaction had already taken place and \u201cyou can\u2019t be responsible how long it takes my bank to show the funds were received.\u201d But I was assured Vivint approved and released the funds. I believe at this point that was a lie. \\I need an answer as to when this is going to be done. Your email is exactly what really was done, a request for the refund was possibly made. \\Why is it a policy for billing and customer service representatives at Vivint to lie to customers rather than actually handling the situation. This has been two weeks now that I have been trying to get an answer to this situation, terrible customer service. \\Please advise as to when the funds were/will actually released. \\\\Sent from my iPhone\\\\On Aug 30, 2018, at 2:57 PM, Mike Mower &lt;michael.mower@vivintsolar.com&gt; wrote:\\\\Hello James,\\\\This email is to confirm that a refund request for $500.00 has been submitted on 8/27/2018.\\\\Regards,\\\\-- \\Michael Mower\\Vivint Solar Collections Workout Specialist\\Ph: (877) 404-4129, opt. 0 ext. 5495\\Mon-Fri, 8:00 AM-4:30 PM, MST\\vivint.Solar  \u2022  vivintsolar.com",

Obviously I have been receiving inquiries from neighbors and friends about the panels on my roof. I tell them that I will NOT give info to them. $250 from Viv is not worth putting these people through what I have been through for over 9 months, because of Viv's lack of commitment to customers.  How do you expect me to pay a bill that is not sent to me...and delays by Viv could have me referred to a collection agency and then affect my credit rating.  I urge you to do more than \"Read every word\", but live up to your part of OUR agreement.  I actually would enjoy a phone call from someone other than Wayne Rogers, ur Sales Mgr.  And the only good representative of Viv, other than the last & final Viv install team!",
