            "I am not very pleased with the service that has been given, i have had problems and every time their has been a problem I have been the one to find it. When this was pitched to me I was told that your system was constantly monitored which come to find out it is not, your online account center is a joke it dose not tell a person with half a brain anything, and further more my bill is now ready almost 2weeks after the month has ended when it was never like that when I first started. Your account professionals don't really do anything but give lip service and spoon feed YOUR company line, and also I really love the fact that if I am not happy with your service or product YOUR employee which I spoke to on the phone 10/07/2017 said that I could always BUY your system what kind of answer is that. So as you maybe able to tell I am not a happy customer and will not be until REAL answers are given and both you and your SALES men are on the same page, and I shall not be giving any referrals of any kind to any one that I know or ask about the panels on my home. So  to recap online account page sucks\\customer service is a joke\\sales do not meet what is stated to customer\\Hope this might help get you on the RIGHT PAGE and not regress further.  But your techs are actually very pleasant to work with THEY  are the ones who have to deal with the crap you people are slinging, just so you know...               Derek swallow",

I also informed them at the time of the appt. that I need at least one panel replaced and during the visit I was then told that I need to be back on- line before the company will release the panels for replacement finally after 2 days I contacted Vivint since no one called me back to schedule that visit and I was told it is a 2 month wait and it looks like 2 panel are not communicating Service is horrible!!!",

            "The service technician named Matt was outstanding.  He has been the only person who had effectively championed for my resolution and for that I am grateful.  Prior to March of this year I have been an amazing referral source for your company.  Due to my ongoing concerns, I have now lost faith in the efficiently that made this company so desirable. \\\\The scheduling department has been less than efficient and this has severely affected my billing.  I have not been able to produce as promised during my contract due to hardware problems with 11 of my panels. and for that i still do not have resolution.\\\\Additionally i have been awaiting my referral fees since 2015.  I have gone above and beyond the respect of any consumer and thought when i contacted Jonathan in May of 2017 and again when i spoke to Aaron in customer service who asked that i once again take time to out together an email of all the text messages between Cameron Catmill and Sterling Jones, that the referral bonus team would review my claim and I would hear back.  That email took me days to put together and my phone requires me to copy and past each text individually to an email.  I wrote to technical support weeks ago and to date have no reply.\\\\I am very disconcerted by the service from these departments and demand immediate satisfaction.  I am now concerned that I will need to report the lack of response over this matter and resolution to my over billing, due to a lack of scheduling repairs to my system that in turn was not able to effectively produce and translate that production to your company as contractually promised for the past 4 months to the Division of Consumer Affairs.  I look forward to immediate resolution perhaps through this communication.  \\\\Thank Matt from service again, he was fabulous, a welcomed visit that the Vivent company can be efficient with the correct attention and dedicated employees.  I can be reached via email, aolinotr@gmail.com or by phone at 908-403-1517",

The right hand never seems to know what the left hand is doing. The communication efforts of your company are very lacking. I don't feel valued as a customer. And when it comes time for reimbursement of lost savings I am told it is some sort of formula. I have no idea if you are dealing fairly. Based on the amount I was reimbursed last time I was not happy and no one could tell me how the figure was arrived at. Seems things are one sided. I make money for you, but you don't return in kind when you are the ones responsible for my down time.",

Couple of docs were not sent in time and I had again follow up with vivint. Its all recoreded. Had a bad experience this time. CASE No: 9894346 sent on April 2016 with detailed email.

            "Good Morning, \\ \\ \\  Enclosed is the PG&E Energy consumption report that I downloaded this morning on the PG&E website.  Please note that as of 9/7/2017 we are now producing solar energy from the solar panels on our house offsetting our power use. There has never been any solar production from your system since we purchased this home.\\ \\ \\  We purchased 2876 Spyglass Court last year and transferred the lease to our name on April 27th, 2016.   Last year I requested the internet monitoring be put on your solar system, but it did not happen. \\ \\  After 3 service calls, Chris and crew have fixed the problems associated with your system.\\ \\- The first call was to install your internet monitoring system.  Chris verified that the system was not producing power, and we had a faulty 40 AMP circuit breaker that Vivint had installed initially.   We did not realize that that breaker, attic fans & lights, controlled 1/4 of our lights in the laundry room, kitchen, living room, garage, and stairway from the garage to the house. \\ \\- The second service call Chris installed the monitoring system, and diagnosed that the system kept popping the 20 AMP circuit breaker downstream of your 40 AMP breaker. \\ \\- The third call Chris and Shane fixed the problem.  After two and one half weeks we could do laundry again, and park our car in the garage!  There was no way this system ever worked. \\ \\ I am requesting full reimbursement of all payments from Vivint from April 27, 2016 through September 6, 2017, plus reimbursement of the $600.00 re-up charge that  PG&E charged us for your yearly fee that shut off our power one Friday and we had to pay to get us back online.   To say I am frustrated is an understatement.  As a landlord I could not legally have left a tenants house without basic power for weeks.   If there would have been follow up last year on my request to install monitoring, this would never have happened.\\ \\ \\Sincerely,\\Len Sullivan\\2876 Spyglass Ct.\\Santa Rosa, Ca 95405",

They fixed the problem.  \\\\But your company, Vivint Solar, never had the ability to read solar production, because the monitoring system was never installed during the initial installation. Your panels have been offline, verified by PG&E, from the time we bought this house, 4/27/2016 unitl 9/7/2017. \\\\I was without power in 1/4 of my house for 2 1/2 weeks.  Unable to do laundry, sat in the dark in our living room waiting for Vivint to fix their problem.  As a landlord I would have been sued for lack of basic services on a rental home.",

            "I'm so glad your asking. We've had a rough year, to busy to keep track of something we believed was being kept track for us. First we had the passing of my mother, who was under Hospice Care in our home. And just 3 short months later, my live in mother in law also passed. So we received an email stating we had been offline, for almost a yr. That just seems like we're being gouged for our monthly cost. How is it that we were being charged based on no information being sent in. Our panels were producing energy and yet we were not given proper credit. So we believe we will be reimbursed for the difference. Not very happy with Vivint at this point. Not sure all the backup information has been downloaded all ready. A whole year of information must take time to take place. Was hoping to hear from someone before hand to get this resolved. But we've already received our new bill, & it's almost at a $100 for the month. Not really seeing a big benefit, for being on solar. \\Again we are very disappointed in how long this matter has taken to be noticed. \\Looking forward to hopefully hearing back from someone with a solution on this important matter. \\Sincerely \\Mrs. Sanchez",

That is when I found out my system hass been down for months. I tried to set up a appointment but was told mo one was available in my area. They were supposed to cal back and never did. A few weeks later I called  and this time made the A appointment. The gentleman came last week and showed me something burned out in the box. He was very nice. We are now waiting for it to get fixed. In the meantime I lost over $500 in credits from eversource and have been not producing anything the entire summer long going into this Winter season is not a good thing. I would still be wondering why I had a low bill and then 80 bell if it had not been for my persistence in contacting your company. I should have been notified it soon as my system went down and that's what I was told when I was sold this contract but that never happened. The reason I was given was because there is not enough people and you are short staffed well I don't think that's an excuse at all  !!",

            "Nothing. John the tech, was great. What is disappointing is the fact that my panels have not been working properly since Oct of 2016, and 4 of them were wired backwards since the installation. I was notified in Aug of a problem - almost a year later!! You have been guesstimating my production since & overcharging me. I hope this matter is taken care of & I will be notified of the credit I should be receiving. Honestly, I don't think I would recommend this company to anyone. It is not very well run, I had to wait 6 weeks to get the technician out to see what was going on with my panels , - which is unacceptable, and I don't think I am saving any money. Like I stated prior, John the tech was great, got to my house at 8 am and worked hard for almost two hours to get things fixed. At least you have one great employee working for you.",

            "Extremely poor communication between customer service and myself. Several times that I have called in regarding issues that I was having I got placed on hold for over 8 minutes only to have the call get dropped. After initial installation I was told that a Vivint representative would drop by to see how things were going only to find out that he was there to try and sell me another product ( a door bell camera ) totally in professional !!! Also after installation I was told that I would be able to monitor my system online. when I tried to do that I was unable to connect. When I called in to enquire about this I was informed that something did not get completed at the time of installation and it would take at least 1 1/2 months to get someone out to fix it. Therefore I was unable to monitor my system for 2 months. I feel that your customer service department really needs a lot of improvement , and as far as your employees who actually come out and do the installation work I do give them an A+",

I supplied 12 months worth of bills and the could see it had been over built.  First they blamed me for signing the build out plan.  Then they told me that even though I was paying vivint too much, due to expcess capacity, I was still paying less then if I was not using solar.  I am again working with Vivint and supplying another 12 month bills.  At this time I do not recommend Vivint to any friends or family and don't mind sharing this story with them.  I don't want to see them go through this, but I shouldn't have to either.  It has been several years that I have been paying for excess energy and no one seems to intent on helping me solve it.",

I have logged over 50 hours on they phone with customer service, taken days off from work and even canceled a weekend trip for my anniversary so i can be home to meet a service call that wound up being cancelled by your support team and was never notified. I even did this survey last year and was given a number to call so I can voice my concerns. A gentleman called me back eventually and left a message and email.

I just got off of the phone with Vivint Customer Service asking for help in understanding what I am paying for to Vivint and how to reconcile that with my ever increasing estimated true-up from PG&E ($717 after 3 months of using solar).  The customer service rep couldn't provide any information at all; she just referred me to \"my power company.\"  With what I am paying to Vivint plus my estimated true-up, I'm not saving anything at all by using solar.  Worst mistake I ever made going this direction.  From my perspective, I'd just as soon turn off the system and just have to deal with the power company, rather than sending money down the black hole of Vivint.  I plan to talk with an attorney about getting out of this contract, as it your service is worthless.  If you would like to restore this customer, please have someone who is knowledgeable and helpful contact me.  I'm pretty sure I won't hear from anyone.

However, now having 2 different systems at double what I would be paying is not what I expected instead of half of what I would be paying is frustrating.  When there was a problem with my systems not communicating, I would have expected this to be immediately rectified by Vivant.  I know I am difficult to get a hold of, but having 2 systems battling for communication from onset should have been recognized immediately.  I feel I deserve a rebate from what I know I have been harvesting and bringing in to your company and therefore overpaying, but I have no way to recompense.  I can only go forward and hope it is positive from here.  I wish there was a way to join the 2 systems to make things easier to track- it makes much more sense to have 1 system per house than 2, just because you installed different systems at different times.  You cannot connect them?  Very difficult for the home owner, especially for payment purposes.  I have had credit card problems and had it corrected for one account, thought it was corrected for both, then found out later I was overdue and problems with the second.

He left a card saying that he resolved the problem by using our WiFi.  I am concerned that there is yet another period where our solar panels' have not been given credit for production.  There was no comment on that .  Since the original installation (which took nearly 6 months to get on-line and producing) there have been some significant problems with the communications and the problem of not getting the benefit of our full production.  The second period was when an upgrade of 8 more panels were installed.  Again there were repeated failures of approvals of the work for about 3 more months when the City of Fresno's inspectors would not sign off on the upgrades.  Vivint's track record has been pretty shoddy in my estimation.  My friends who have purchased their solar systems outright have had services established  virtually without delay.  Thank you.

The rest of the process of being a Vivint customer deserves a 0/10 -- hence my 5/10 rating.\\\\Our new homeowner transfer process has been horrendous.\\\\We had no help or guidance -- just a slurry of auto-generated emails after a month of zero contact and silence from Vivint.\\\\The account number we had been given allowed us access to the previous homeowner's bank account information -- but with no ability to pay for our bill.\\\\When the old homeowners left, the Vivint grid's AC Disconnect box was zip-tied into the OFF position. Our web-enabled bridge box was taken. This resulted in a $132 double billing, where we paid for solar and paid our local utility company for the same kWh.\\\\This has been awful.\\\\I'm very unlikely to recommend Vivint to anyone at this point.\\\\For the love of God and all things holy, please, please, please correct and improve the new homeowner transfer service. It seems like Vivint has given like zero thought to new homeowner transfers.

Your company is awesome when they are selling you the product, but extremely lacking after the panels are on the house.

            "I have been with your company now for about 2 years. Everything was going great until we had to sell our house and found out that you all did not get all the inspections and permits from out HOA. So we were told by the HOA we had to paint the conduit to match the house and roof. I talked to many vivint staff memebers about this. The first person was Hadley who talked directly to our HOA. He said everything was scheduled and a painter would come out to paint on Sept 5. Someone did come out but wasn't a painter and he didn't have any paint. I called back to reschedule the paint and talked to Valarie. She argued with me that vivint will not supply the paint. I told her Hadley already discussed this with our HOA. She said vivint will not supply the paint. I asked to speak to a supervisor but she said, \"No I have answered your question and there is no need to talk to a supervisor. Here at vivint we don't allow ppl to talk to supervisors\" I said you have not answered my question and would like to speak to a supervisor. She again said \"No I have answered you question\"....finally after several back and forths. She put me on a hold (without music this time). She came back and said I talked to my supervisor and she said you have to submit paper work from your HOA. I submitted the paperwork and called back. I talked to Lee who scheduled the painters with paint for Sept 25. On Sept 25 a person showed up and said he wasn't a painter and he doesn't have a paint. But we had another problem with the converter that he could \"fix\" So I got to talk to Jordan from fleet. He said Shane will be out today...Shane never showed up nor called. I ended up scheduling another painting on Sept 27 (the last day we own the house). Having no faith in Vivint and Since I had to have this painted before closing I decided to buy the paint and paint it myself. I was given permission by Valarie and her supervisor to do this. I painted the house conduit but did not have a ladder long enough to reach the roof. That day a person form vivint did show up. He said he wasn't a painter and he didn't have any paint. But he would paint the roof for us once he heard out situation. His name was Mike. And to note out neighbor is having the same situation. They have now had 3 scheduled appointments with no painting being done. Your customer support team has no idea what is going on in the field and the field workers don't have a clue what the customer support team is doing. You have no communication between the two groups. I had other problems with vivint such as my sales person Nic Yucha lying to us about the removal price. Tried to work it out with Alfonzo but he never would return my phone calls or give me updates. Another example was the cancellation of our removal last minute. Your company needs a lot of help. On the plus side everyone was nice but they just didn't know what was going on....with anything, If you would like to contact me and discuss this further my number is 4437981180. Thanks\\Chad Nixon",

This was just after I received a call and email three months after I moved into this house, stating I owed $811 without a bill ever being sent.  So, a tech doesn't have my contact info, but when Vivint wants money without sending a bill, I get contacted?  Not happening.  I was then contacted by Vivint on 10/20 about the internet connection issue, which was the reason for the tech coming out.  That appointment is allegedly set for 11/20.  I also requested to pay the bill, which I once again did not receive on or around 10/10 per the email of 9/22.  So, I paid that.  Today, customer service contacted me about an appointment for the internet connection issue.  Really, doesn't anyone check the records?  Give me a break.",

            "We've had our solar panels for 9 months, 7 months in and we received a $50 power bill, month 8 was $250, & month 9 exceeded that.  The purpose of us buying your products was to save money. Nobody was monitoring our panels as we were promised when we signed up, I as the home owner discovered the problem when I received 3 power bills that exceeded what we had paid for the last several months, it was like we didn't even have solar.  When we called for service it took 2 weeks to get a technician all the while we were racking up a huge electricity bill.  We called our power company and Vivint to seek a refund for the time that our panels weren't operational and was turned away. We chose Vivint over 5 other solar companies because you are a reputable company and I have family that works for you and stands by your products.  But frankly I'm disappointed and extremely upset that we have had problems not even a year into service, and your company was not as helpful at a time where we needed your services.  I am second guessing my decision to go solar based on my recent situation.  I really thought that you would be helpful with the problem catching it before I did, solved the problem promptly by having  more than 1 technician for an entire state, and to help rectify my bill when it was apparent that your products weren't functioning as they were designed to do so.\\I will say that your technicians were nice and knowledgeable they explained the problem and the solution to me in a way that I could understand and showed me how to better monitor my system.",

They were trying to take responsibility for something that in truth they didn't do.  That's dishonest and a slap in the face to me as the homeowner.  If they would have discovered the problem it wouldn't have taken two months to get it fixed",

I have had the system fail a few times and getting it repaired was an issue. In fact, I had a technician come out just recently because your system screwed up. After a months  delay, we sat around our house waiting for the tech, only to discover that without trying to contact us he tagged the door and left. We had to make another appointment, another month out. When the tech came (late) he discover he needed a part he didn't have. He contacted another tech who was to come the next day, instead after waiting most of thatappointment, your office called to say that you didn't  have the part after all and he had to wait for ANOTHER appointment three weeks later when the problem was solved. Again, yes, it was solved, but only after FOUR separate appointments and incredibly crappy communication AND TRULY HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!",

I did not let him in because he might not be a legit Vivint tech,  though he is wearing a Vivint shirt. Last month, we were in Hawaii and a tech came to our house.  He was let in by a worker we authorized to be in our house.  Please, next time you want to do a routine or emergency maintenance, a simple e-mail or phone call in advance would be a nice way of doing business.  Thanks.",

The problem is that my roof was leaking from the initial install.  it was fixed but the process took too long and then when It was finished only half of my panels were working.  No one ever contacted me to inform me, so I didn't figure it out until I got a huge true up bill from PG&E.  It took over a month to get someone out to fix the panels once we found out they were not working.  I need to be credited for the inflated electric bill.",

Vivint's service regarding notifying you when the panals are not working is horrible and when we had to have them service there was no call to confirm our service time/date and it was cancelled and re-scheduled without even contacting us. That part of Vivint really needs to be fixed because it is very frustrating. Other than that we do like our lower monthly bill, when the panals are working correctly",

I would assume that I should be making more per day now then I did in the earlier months but that is not what it is showing. I feel and so do the people I have talked with on your team that should be the case but here again no one can tell me why it is not. I had a service guy show up on the 14th, he updated some software but I have not seen a change in any of my numbers. I feel there is a issue with my system, maybe some of the panels are not producing like they should or at all ? I am disappointed in the fact that I cannot talk to someone that can answer my questions, also disappointed in the fact that the service guy comes to my area once a week on Mondays and that is it.

I keep data and my system supposedly in two winter months for the past 2 years has \"produced\" exactly what was projected - that is how I was billed - truct me that is not possible. I really like the people from Vivint initially and that is why I went with you - but I could not recommend your company to anyone as the service has been so bad - it has really been dissapointing as I am such a clean energy proponent. Again - the people are great (once they finally get here) but to have someone 1500 miles away tell me my system is working fine when the data says otherwise and I have to provide pictures of my fault light on is unacceptable in today's customer centric environment. I guess a bad \"rgm\" meter that led to other issues - but shouldn't you know that when monitoring my system ? Very dissapointing!",

            "My comment is based more on the events that led to the need for the service call rather than the service call itself.  Back in February or March of 2017, I discovered that one of my panels was not working.  I discovered this when I called because my system was not communicating properly.  A service appointent was scheduled for several weeks from that date.  A technician came out, but said he was unable to complete the repair because it was a 2-tech job.  Another appointment was scheduled for about 6 weeks later.  That appointment had to be cancelled due to weather, and was rescheduled for me for a date that was not convenient for me, about 2 months later.  I encountered many difficulties in trying to reschedule; the details should be in my file, as I made numerous calls to your customer service department.  The repair was finally completed in August.  My complaint is not only with the length of time it took to complete the repair, but with the difficulty in getting information.  It turns out that the repair did not require 2 techs; the person who originally scheduled the repair put in wrong information, and it took several months and several inquiries from me to get someone to discover the real problem.  Additionally, each time I called I got a different person, who gave me different information.  One time I called and someone from customer service was trying to schedule the service appointment, couldn't get someone one the phone so sent an email.  When I hadn't heard back after about a week and called again, I was told that the person who would be the one to schedule the appointment was on vacation and that's why nothing had been done.   Was there no one covering for that person?  I could go one, but the notes of my phone calls should be in my file; at least that is what I was told.  The bottom line is it was quite frustrating as a customer to have to speak to a different person every time, and to get different information with each phone call. Everyone I spoke to was very pleasant, and tried to help me, but it seemed that there was a lack of communication within the company-the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing so to speak.  Perhaps if there had been one person in charge of my account the problem could have been solved more quickly, and I would have been given consistent accurate information about the status of my repair.",

            "My system had been broken since May and despite more that a dozen phone calls, it was not fixed until August 18th.  I was told you did not have anyone in my area to fix it.  I lost three months of production.  I happen to notice it was not working...I never received a call from you to notify me.  I tried calling and asking for a supervisor and never got a call back on several occasions.  I called the corporate office and was told I could not speak to anyone in the COO's office or resolution  management.  When the techs finally showed up, they told me they both lived in a neighboring town but they do installs not service!!  Really, so you can sell the product but do not care about servicing your customers once the system is in?  I lost production all summer.  when the system was sold to me I was told there were people monitoring the system and if there was an issue, I would get a phone call.  Secondly, your departments do not communicate. Why doesn't billing know what going on?.  They sent me a bill for estimated production for a system that his not functioning and they want me to pay??  I tried to call them and was on hold three times for over 30 minutes and no one ever picked up.  How is that ethical?  Now it will take me 7 months like it did last year( yes this is my second go around ) to get my money back.  Your company does not care at all about the customers.. your customer service  people have no idea of the infrastructure of your company.  The only positive thing I can say is the people who answer are very professional...I actually feel bad for them that they send messages to supervisors who can't even call you back.  I have no confidence in your company and feel that I deserve at least monetary compensation  for the astronomical electrical bills I was trying to avoid by getting solar panels.",

            "We have had an ongoing customer service issue with Vivint solar.  The panels on our house were installed directly underneath a tree branch that belongs to a tree on our neighbor's side of the fence.  Consequently, our panels are almost completely shaded by the tree and additionally have a built up accumulation of leaves that have obscured about 1/3 of the panels.  When the panels were installed, we were told that maintenance, including cleaning, is the responsibility of Vivint Solar.  However, a year later, several requests to look at the placement of the panels and also requests for maintenance service, have been either ignored or blown off by local reps.  The most recent service call was completely and totally unnecessary.  There is nothing wrong with our panes EXCEPT that they have not been maintained.  Yet a technician spent hours here replacing perfectly good parts, even admitting that the service was pointless!!  I have been told to just \"wash them with a power washer.\"  Well, I don't have a power washer.  Being a good sport, and up on the ladder to clean gutters in any case, I did try to clean the lower panels myself using a hose nozzle.  Unfortunately, the built up dirt and leaf decay was NOT responsive to the spray.  Now, if Vivint can afford to pay a technician to replace non-defective parts, why can't they send someone to maintain the panels properly so that they work??!!??  I don't have the equipment, knowledge, or tools to properly clean the panels, not to mention that I have no interest in climbing around on the roof!!  With the level of service I've received from Vivint Solar, I would NEVER recommend them to friend, acquaintance, or to be quite frank, even to someone I didn't like very well.",

We have even been instructed multiple times to call back in if we don\u2019t hear back from your reps. I even spoke with a \u201cmanager\u201d who didn\u2019t have the decency to follow up. What kind of customer service is that? I should be able to rely on you for follow up. You are the ones in customer service and I am the customer. In addition we have been given different information each time we call in- two reps have to be scheduled to come- no, only one rep needs to come - you have to be there- no you don\u2019t have to be there. Last time the field people came out they came for a completely different reason (updating the computer system) than what we had called for (broken panel) and the issue of the broken panel is still not fixed!! It has been more than frustrating dealing with Vivint and we would NEVER recommend going solar with your company. Wish you would change you systems of command and have people on one side know what the other side is doing. There is some kind of communications system failure that you need to repair.",

            "System has not been working properly for more than 1 year.  Had to make repeated calls to customer service, very long wait times.  Then I WAS TOLD OVER 20 OF MY 36 PANELS NOT WORKING!.  Vivint said they would need to send 2 service people at same time.  Promised to call back to schedule.  It took months for Vivint to get it scheduled.  Then they replaced 2 panels, and part in 27 other panels.  Service man said many probloems with this part in many, many panels.  I asked them to change the part in all my panels,, but they did not in 7 panels.  Right now system tells me that 2 out of 36 panels still not working.  Thats what it said when service man was here, but he left it that way anyway.  When will Vivint return and fix all panels.  This system has actually caused my electric cost to increase.  How do I get reimbursed for the lost time my system wsa not working?  How do I get compensated for all ther time I had to spend on phone with Vivint .  How do I get compensated for several hours of compiling and comparing bills and KWH for National Grid & Vivint?",

Unreliable system, failing micro inverters resulting in low production, or sometimes ZERO production for weeks on end (as is the case now), billing me when my system is down, waiting several weeks to get an appointment with a technician, extremely rude phone agents who appear to care less about getting my system fixed and telling me I cannot speak to a supervisor.

            "Let me start by saying the workers and customer service have been very nice. Here are the negative issues we've experienced:\\1. It's been over 3 months since our panels have been working due to scheduling cancellations and miscommunications between Vivint and SDG&E. Ever since Vivint installed additional panels to our existing ones 3 months ago, I've been on the phone constantly trying to coordinate turning the panels back on. In addition, we've lost a lot of money to SDG&E due to high electric bills, which the panels would have helped cover.\\2. When the workers came out to install an upgraded circuit panel on the side of the house I was told the power would be off for 4 hours. It ended up being off for more than 9 hours. \\3. While installing the circuit panel, workers cut the wires to our pool filter. I was told they'd be back right away to fix, however, it took 6 days for them to come back and our pool turned green. After calling several times, Vivint assured me they'd be out on Friday to fix. I waited around all day and no one showed up. They ended up showing up the next day Saturday at 7am in the morning waking up my whole family. \\3. The workers also removed our lattice and put a large hole in the side of our living room, both of which still haven't been fixed (it's been a week).",

Please look at the repair record of 9210 Cadorett, Santee CA 92071 and you will know why I think Vivant is a Horrible company. I would like to have Vivant's equipment removed from both houses and never have to deal with this company again! Is there someone at Vivant that can make this right?  I have been told by every customer service person that no one cares! Next appointment to see if someone can fix it ( 6th appointment) isn't until 7/11 and all CS could say is \"its the best we can do\" REALLY!! I am on the board of a 300 home HOA and own a RE company and I can tell you I am letting everyone I know how Vivant works. So sorry it has to be so negative, I guess that's in Vivant's court now I've tried and tried to make this right. Very Disappointed Pattie Conway 858-243-5277",

I requested a repair team A.S.A.P. but was informed that the earliest date was June 12th.  I called service on June 7th to confirm that a 2 man repair team would be here on the 12th, however on June 12th only one repair man showed up and was unable to replace a broken invertor by himself.  Only after I informed the service group that if they could not get the system back on line soon that I would consider requesting them to remove the system did they expedite sending out a two man team. On June 17th they replaced the invertor and restored the system to service. I am disappointed in Vivint after knowing the system had failed that it took over 2 months to send a team out to repair the system and only after multiple calls from me. It's difficult to recommend Vivint Solar after this recent experience.",

He explained how we can tell if the system was working (which, apparently it has not been working a lot) and how to tell if we need to call for service.  What I don't understand is why wasn't this taught to us a year ago when we signed up?  I am finding that we are paying more for our electricity than we were before we had the panels installed - largely because they are so often off line.  I find Vivant to be expensive and unresponsive.  I will be scanning my Edison electric bills to your solar technical support office to renegotiate my contract because next month I will be paying more for your electricity per Kwh than Edison's fee - NOT WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR!",

Problems from the beginning, damage to my house, Vivint giving the city the wrong plans and it causing a 3 month delay in the city giving the ok for me to turn it on, the box converter on my roof burned up and I nor anyone from Vivint knew for weeks and now I have a huge bill with So Cal Edison. Also it took Vivint over 2 weeks to make an appointment to have someone fix my roof after they came and saw the burned up box, I called a week after they came to make the appointment because no one had called after a week and I was told my number was in the cue and I'd be called back in a week to make the appointment, which took Vivint more than an additional week to call me, then they made an appointment for a week later and called the day before the appointment and said they scheduled the wrong kind of appointment they needed more techs and a longer appointment time to fix my problem so it would be reschduled.....hasn't been an experience I'd want to refer anyone to",

The service visit was fine, and the technician was extremely professional, but my experience with Vivint has been terrible from the get-go.  The latest problem is that I had called because we found a squirrel nest under our panels and the earliest that you could schedule an inspection was 1.5 months later.  When the technician arrived on Thursday, he told me he had to shut the system down because there were chewed, exposed wires and it was a fire hazard.  So my house has been in that state for an extra 1.5 months because Vivint couldn't find time to inspect my home.  I'm sure if I had called to say that I had someone who was interested in solar and could they send out a salesperson, it would not have taken 1.5 months.",

Doesn't make sense to me, since said \"white noise\" should impact all panels, not just one set.  Separately, I am very disappointed in customer service in general (though the tech phone team is generally responsive and helpful).  I have emailed Bryan Christiansen directly to address my frustrations, but the experiences I've had with customer service have clouded my opinion of the whole Vivint Solar operation.  I hope that my email to Mr. Christiansen will result in my being back on track to having a positive opinion of Vivint Solar again.",

We have an analog meter.  Chris took a picture with his cell and sent it to his supervisor, who agreed it is the wrong meter.  I called Central Hudson twice&lt; they insist it is ok and refuse to send anyone out to replace it.  this was August 16th.  I have called Vivent 3 times and spoke with a service representative.  I still have not heard back about a resolution to this problem. My panels are off so I would appreciate getting this resolved as soon as possible.

            "My overall experience with Vivint has been disappointing and frustrating. First off, our solar lease was included in the escrow of the house we just purchased on 6/21. I haven't received any finalized, signed transfer agreements from Vivint, nor are these transfer documents included on my online account. Once our escrow was finalized, there was no follow-up from Vivint on the details of our contract or services. Second, we began receiving late notices from Vivint indicating that we had a past due balance. No billing or account access had been provided to me so there was no way for us to know we had a balance. We continued to receive past due notices, yet were not able to access our account. Third, two months after our escrow closed we received notice that our system has issues and was not communicating with the server for billing. The service guy came out to our house and fixed the issue. He was the only pleasant representative of Vivint that we have dealt with in our experience thus far. He informed us that our system had not been communicating to the server for many months and it would take 4 days for everything to be updated. I'm trying to understand how we have been billed for two months of service if our system wasn't communicating. How was our invoice determined? Are we owed credit for incorrect billing since you didn't have any information on our system? I have currently been on hold with your Customer Service for almost 20 minutes....past calls have placed me on hold for 25 minutes multiple times within the same call. I would like to get these issues resolved but your CS is virtually impossible to reach and making my experience of Vivint extremely negative. We have taken down the sign in front of our house that promotes our use of Vivint and are considering dissolving our contract. I'm extremely frustrated and disappointed in the service we have received and feel your company has a lot of work to do in order to be successful, relevant and sustainable.",

I've lived here since April 20th and I've asked multiple times even before I moved in to have Vivint come out and show me things about the solar system. I found out on this service visit that 30 of my solar panels hadn't been working. This could have been avoided if Vivint had came when I was off work the week I moved in like I asked them too. Every other company was there literally the day I moved in except Vivint. Buying my house was much easier than getting Vivint transferred over to me.",

            "Months ago pigeons nested under my (and several of my neighbors') solar panels.  Vivent installed animal guards.  Now that pigeons are back, vivent service tech saw numerous openings in guards which allowed the same issue.  I was told by vivent to PAY YET AGAIN for pigeon removal, which a local roofer did for 100.00 cash.  He found HUGE clumps of accumulated debris (slip ties, wires, etc) which clogged my BRAND NEW gutters requiring him to dismantle the gutters to remove pigeon debris!  I have submitted pictures of debris.  Than Vivent returned to reinstall guards properly.  The next day my gutter company came to repair the damage to the gutters caused by Vivent.  He went on my roof and saw that pigeons RETURNED!!!!!!  I paid 150.00 for the gutter repair.  This bill was submitted to you.  So, after MONTHS of this issue which should have been curtailed from the start as you must know this can be an issue in this part of the country, I am listening to the pigeons as we speak and waiting for Vivent to yet again return.  I am beyond pissed.  Would like to mention that the tech, Sebastian is a wonderful young man, eager to help, very professional, etc.  Unfortunately he did not block the pigeons.  Amanda in customer service is very sympathetic but that does not fix this issue.",

            "Good Morning, \\ I had contacted Customer service on two separate occasions now, since your last email. I have requested assistance with the pricing noting two unresolved issues.\\\\1) We never had a problem with our gutters and snow issues until the solar panels were installed. We strongly feel that the cost associated with the installation of the guards be split between Vivint Solar and myself. We should have been advised about this possible issue prior to joining into a partnership with Vivint. It is obvious Vivnt is aware of this type of issue.\\2) We never received our $250.00 gift card for recommending and encouraging our next door neighbor to joining and installing Vivint Solar panels\\\\In both my calls I was told someone would get back to me. This has still not happened.\\\\Any assistance you provide to encourage Customer Service to look into this and return my calls would be appreciated.",

            "First of all, the supervisor whom I spoke over the phone promised me that the technician will give me a call 30 minutes before he arrives. He did not call. I got time off from work in my very busy schedule and stayed home from 8-11 and expecting the technician. He never knocked on the door or rang a bell. He entered my house without permission and all he did was just rebooting the system from outside (not fixing the issue that I have had). I will not allow anyone entering my house without my permission. The technician just wasted my time. The reason for the appointment was simply fixing the issue I had with solar edge with my wifi which your technical team failed to help me over the phone. The supervisor promised me to follow up one day after the appointment. She never did. I still have the issue after I have been trying to have someone from Vivint to help me since one months ago.\\\\Very disappointing customer service!!!\\\\Ahmad Falahatpisheh, PhD\\785 Poppy Rd\\San Marcos, CA",

The initial problem was that the panels were not functioning for two months after the installation because of a simple issue that could\u2019ve been easily fixed (and was fixed) in five minutes.  We lost the two best months of the year because of a mistake on the side of the technician. Vivint did not take us serious when I made call after call for someone to fix the problem. As the consumer of this product, I felt that once Vivint got the $46,000, they could care less about me or the issues we were facing. As I did some calculations of my own, we lost over $500 in lost power production. I called Vivint after the problem had finally been resolved and ask for compensation for the two months. In a professional way, they told me it wasn\u2019t their problem because I financed the project- like that had anything to do with the issue at hand. In short, you have a very unhappy customer.

I have a problem with two panels that are under production. They are not production like the other 39 panels. I have as told that they are lazy panels. I have lost about 30 kwh out of both panels. I paid over 40,000 dollars for a 10.87 kwp system That not even getting 8 kwp at the most per day. I was told that there is no guarantee on the system in the contract. I got what I have and there is no fixing it. I went with Vinit because of the name. I found that the Vinit is like dealing with a fly by night company.",

I am expected to carry the full burden of Vivint's mistake. I was told today the refund process takes 2-3 months. Meanwhile where am I suppose to come up with that kind of money due to Vivint's error. Please do not site the contract, I get it. The contract is fool proof even when it comes to covering the companies errors. I regret ever having gone solar. I regret ever having anything to do with Vivint. I will continue spreading my complaints with the BBB and social media. I have already talked my in laws out of going with your company. All I want is accurate billing and an expediated refund of my money. I should not have to suffer for Vivint's mistake. Where is this company's accountability?",

I get billed every month and my modem hasn't been communicating for at least six months. I tried to get the billings to stop and was told I could not do it. For three months the inverter was off and had to be replaced, yet I was still billed every month. I have called repeatedly and nobody can help. I finally got a date for last week, nobody showed up and I had to call again. Supposedly someone is now coming out on October 12th, I have never experienced anything like this before in my life. I have had nothing but trouble from the day these panels were installed. It started when your man measured my roof and the panels were made up to fit accordingly. When the installers came out to install them they discovered the measurement was off by one hundred and forty feet. Needless to say I wound up with fewer panels and was left with a roof where I can no longer have access to clean my gutters. It has been a horrible nightmare from day one.",

Also, I was having tremendous difficulty with the website. When I called for support, no one could initially tell me that I had to use google chrome going forward and not plain google. I also wasn't getting every email on the 10th of the month to tell me what my auto billing amount would be on the 20th of every month. It was frustrating not to be able to access the web to get the billing info I was missing. I seem to be able to access the wqebsite now using google chrome.

Please I can't afford another big power bill on top of my loan payment \\Richard Holtshouser",

            "We contacted Vivint back in March to replace 4 solar panels that were damaged.  Vivint finally scheduled to replace the 4 panels in June.  Apparently, there was a change in supervisor or manager at the Fresno office.  Our schedule was lost.  Finally I went to the Fresno Office personally and walked into the  warehouse with the manager and found the panels wrapped and ready to be installed.  I do not believe that the work would have been done if I had not gone there personally. The installers did a great job, the new manager was a great help, but Vivint communication is lacking tremendously.  Due to this, it is difficult to recommend the company to a friend or relative.  Also, our NEM Tru-Up charges on our electric bill is currently around $900.00.  We had to send our bills to Vivint to receive a refund last year.  Do we need to do this again.   We thought solar was going to save us $$$.  Let's see if we receive a response from Vivint over this survey.",

After 4 months of delays your system was finally pulled off my roof so my storm damage repairs could be done (damage worsened by the delay caused by your company's uncaring callous lack of effort), then after 3 more months delays on your part, Sept. 15th your crew re-installed them.... almost. They could not link to the internet and the part they needed was the one part all San Diego crews are fighting over. None available. So the system on my roof was non-operable. Monday I was told today between 8 and 11 a technician would come and get the system running. At 11:30 that day I called and learned \"the tech was delayed at the current job and will be 1-1 1/2 hours late. He couldn't be bothered to let us know he was running late I guess. Near 1:30 PM I called- \"he's on the road and will be there within 30 min. I guess he still couldn't be bothered to give us some advance notice. At 1:49 PM my wife texted me he'd arrived.So Thursday, Sept 21st- a week later, my system is running once again. I still haven't been offered any considerations regarding the mounting financial burden all this has placed on me because my system was down for three months. \\And here's the crowning touch: my 'true up' bill with SDG&E. $780.35.\\Add to that your non-performance penalty of $102.19 for the system you couldn't seem to get operational. Plus the ceiling tiles damaged by rain leaking through my roof because of your 'scheduling' problems.\\\\You have cost me $882.54. Plus uncountable numbers of calls, texts, emails- AND STRESS TO MYSELF, MY WIFE, AND MY MARRIAGE as I try to keep everyone happy and on an even Keel.\\Check my earlier emails and calls and be informed of my frustrations/irritations.\\I'm not amused\\I'm not happy\\\\This is infuriating. I am angry.\\Again I ask, demand, Make This Right.",

The reason why I gave an 8 is because customer service for Vivent has been calling me for a number of months and I told them that I needed the service call to be made on Saturday. I also mentioned to the customer service department that if Vivent didn't have to come into the house, they can come at their earliest convenience. These phone calls went on for months, and nothing was ever resolved until this past weekend. Dennis climbed up to the roof and informed that there was severe animal damage (squirrels eating through the wiring) and that's why my panels have not been communicating any information Vivent. He said he was going to send a report to Vivent so they can come by and fix the wiring and animal proof the panels.",

I am however stuck with this company and the panels and there is not much I can do about it. I not only have not referred anyone to Vivint but I have turned several away who even knock on my door asking about the company. My brother who lives a few miles from me almost made the mistake of choosing your company and I am glad to say he will be having his solar installed by another provider next month.

            "On July 8th, your electrician, Carmen, was very informative. He removed the cover and saw that there was corrosion and water inside the inverter causing the system to go down.\\\\My solar system has been down more than it has been up.\\\\Once again the system has been down since June 15th and once again I have to wait another 25 days before an electrician is available to install a replacement inverter. which is completely unacceptable.  I requested that Carmen be the electrician on the service call and was told that he was not available. This will be  the fifth service call.  You definetly need to hire more electricians because it is not fair to the customer to have to wait three plus weeks to correct the problem.\\\\By the way I called on Monday and asked for a supervisor.  I spoke to Brandon and he told me that someone would call in 24 to 48 hours with an appointment.  I waited 48 hours and no call.  Was I surprised hell no!!!  Once again I had to call Vivint and was told an electrician would not be available until August 3rd ...unbelievable!!!.  I am losing the best production time again.\\\\I will be looking for a credit for the lost production.\\\\Jean Jardim\\\\If you look at the history of my account you will see why I am so frustrated.",

The issue is the length of time it took for Vivint HQ to notify me of a communication problem (approx. 3+ weeks) and to schedule a service tech (approx. 2-3 weeks)....I suggest Vivint develop the means that immediately notifies the customer whenever a communication problem is identified by the system. In turn, the customer could contact Vivint in an attempt to resolve it or to schedule (in a timely fashion) a service technician. This is the 2nd time we've had a communication problem. The 1st time took months to identify and resolve.",

I live in Fresno, its hot my NEM is at $1000.00  This is the tiime to produce power to PG&E  My system is not producing and hasn't been producing and won't be procucing anytime soon. Why do I have SOLAR?  Between my bills to Vivant,PG&E and my NEM charges am I better off???? I have struggled with this PG&E NEM thing ever since solar came into my life. I now have two systems on my roof. 2 different bills!? Original 17 panels and now a total of 23 panels and I'm still struggling to fight the NEM charges. I have double pane windows, re-stuccoed and insulated my home and now with faulty equip and slow service I'm still looking at a $1000.00 NEM bill coming soon.  Am I satisfied ?  NO!! Am I angry?

The technician who came was very helpful but he also said it would help him if he and others like him were trained in understanding energy bills.  I had asked him to explain our bill.  It looks like we are producing twice as much as we are using and yet it looks like we will need to pay our other energy company at the end of our solar year.  If that is the case, we are not happy.  So we are waiting to see what happens in another month.  Also, our solar panels were not communicating for almost three months and it took our call to get the ball moving on fixing that.  I feel we should be getting a call in less than a month if there is a problem.  Thanks for listening.",

            "The experience of the visit was fine.  He was helpful, found the problem and fixed it.  Updated the software so my solar box talks to the Vivant office.  My problem has been in the first year of service with Vivant- and the lack of follow thru by Vivant when you noticed technical issues with my system.  I'll admit I did not respond to an email from Vivant early on in the process, but when I got someone out  after 1 year and a very large PGE \"true-up\" invoice for over 1,000 dollars- I discovered my system was not generating any KW.  In May a technician got the black and red wires installed correctly (as they were not installed correctly 1 year ago when first installed).  Only to find out now I needed a second visit to get my system back on line- so Vivant can track how much my system is producing.  I have been charged monthly for over a year at least $40 a month for a non-working system that was producing no solar power- and I have to pay PGE true up charges because I had to pay them for all the electricity I used due to a non-functioning solar system.  Its now July 16, 2017 and Ive been checking my vivant box daily- I'm definitely producing KW hours, I believe the office is now tracking my useage- so Id like someone to contact me about a refund of fee's I am due.  Monthly fees have been  automatically withdrawn from my checking account each month.  I will be agreeable to a credit for the next year as well- because I do want to produce solar power.  I can be reached at 408 300-8380 my cell phone- or my email Cathyconsulting@gmail.com",

            "We sighned up with Vivint in April . After they put it up is when everything fell apart . Our neighbor  across the street signed up after us and in 3 to 4 weeks he was up in running before us.  Several Months Later and I mean September we finally got the ok.  It seem every turn there was something not done or didn't work and when we would follow up on it the right hand didn't know what the left hand was doing.  One day a tech was to come to the house when he didn't show we called.  They told us he'd already been there . Two hours later a tech shows up at our house.  Last month we thought we were collecting our solar for a month now and an inspector came out and said it wasn't reading right . So as of right now I don't even know if its doing anything or just collecting dust on our roof top.  We missed all of the summer heat because of your company's incompetence and I truly feel that you should of paid for our last two months electric bill.  I suggest in the future you need to get your process more fine turned\\Sincerly Linda Gasco",

The person who walked me through the system had no idea what she was telling me and actually had me turn of the system because she was working off of a script. I told her she was switching the system off but she stated that it was what he document said. When the system still did not work she asked if I changed my wifi carrier. I told her I did when I moved in to this house in March. She said that is when it stopped calculating the solar minutes. This was August you just found this out????? She stated that I could ask for a assessment to see if I was over charged. I need to ask you to correct a error that you just found out about in August and let go for 6 months. I did not have a choice when I brought the house but I still have not seen a contract.",

I have pigeons that have nested under the panels and the rep. informed me that I would have to get rid of the nests and birds before they could install the bird wire to keep them out. I feel this is your equipment I have no idea how to remove or get rid of the birds without possible damanging the equipment not to mention that now they are going to charge me for the wire and installation to protect your equipment.  If I had wanted to be responsible for the maintenance of the equipment I would of bought it or leased it.  I also did not receive a refund from Edison as I was told and I am going on the third year and have had to pay an additional $200. each year.  So if someone asked me about your company for Solar I would not recommend you.  I have spoken to numerous other people with solar and they do receive a refund from Edison and have no problems with service. I worked in the public for over 40 years and the goal was how do we keep our customers happy?  Perhaps your company should review some of their service policies and find out why customers aren't getting what they were told they would receive.",

No one came out or called us when we took over the panels to ensure we were educated in 2016.  I called set up a initial appointment and resulted in a no show.

Each individual I spoke with at Vivint would refer me to someone else.  I finally got referred to \"Solar Workout\".  The individuals there had no knowledge of my account.  It was very frustrating.",

Called #2 extension, they sent out the same technician(very nice and knew his equipment) when he changed the converter he sent in work order to change the serial # from new converter to be transferred to my account. I had to actually call #2 extension again to ask them to change serial #.Within 5 minutes it was adjusted and within half hour I got into my account.

            "Vivint Solar is without a doubt the worst company I have ever dealt with in my entire life. The company is clearly dedicated almost solely to sales, and not to customer service. We have had a two-year ordeal with the company, in which we've had to deal with countless terrible customer service personelle (Michelle Torres, Nicholas Ryland Rigby, Tanner Baumgartner, et al.), many of whom are completely incompetent, willfully negligent, and/or downright unresponsive. The company routinely breaks rules (doesn't ask for approval to come to our roof) and does everything in its power to inconvenience customers (e.g., not showing up for appointments, failing to do the maintenance/work that is required, failing to respond to queries, billing improperly). I wish I had never had any experience with Vivint Solar at all. I would get hours and hours back of time wasted on emails and phone conversations with terrible Vivint employees. At our last service meeting, moreover, the technician (who never seems to have done the work he was supposed to do) informed me that Vivint customers routinely complain about how bad your service is. So, it seems, Vivint is known to be a disaster. I hope you go out of business.",

Sometimes these technicians don't show up, and they never call us to tell us that they aren't coming. They never come in the window of time that they are supposed to arrive. They either don't perform their work properly, or they don't finish the work, and then they leave, without telling the customer anything. We have no idea if our roof was fixed, and no one has responded to our query about it. Yaritza (\"Michelle\") Torres is managing our account, and she claims that she's very high up in the company, so high up, in fact, that she reports directly to the CEO. She's a terrible employee: she takes forever to respond, routinely lies, and is deeply unhelpful. A little Googling of Michelle demonstrates that she's in her 20s and hasn't even finished college yet. *This* is the sort of person who is high up in your company and reports directly to the CEO? If so, your desire to ask customers how you are doing is a sham: you know your customer service is terrible, and you don't care, because you lock customers into long-term contracts and don't allow them to sue you without arbitration--arbitration that is obviously titled toward your own benefit. This company has treated us so badly it's criminal.",

            "I have only had service since May.  You installed panels on my 22-year old house which desperately needs a new roof.  Your inspector said it (the roof)  looked great so I felt CONfident in checking the box that said my roof was in good condition with the prompting of my salesman (who resigned soon after the activation?).  Now, you want to charge me $4,000 to remove the panels so I can have a new roof installed.  I could have had the roof done before if I would have only been advised.\\\\After a tile fell off the house where your installers accessed the roof for installation and my next door neighbor was having her house re-roofed, I asked the roofer to come over and look at my roof.  He pointed out dry rot, loose tiles and took some pictures of broken tiles that I am unable to see from the ground.  He said solar panels never should have been put on a roof this old and in this much need of replacement.  Two other roofers concurred with his assessment.  I am not a structural engineer or a roofing contractor so I stupidly trusted the Vivint  inspector.  \\\\I am disgusted with Vivint and disgusted with myself for being such a sucker. This will obviously be of no benefit to me as it would take years to make up for the $4.000 that you want to charge me so I can re-roof my house.  In the meantime I pay you a monthly charge while you take the government rebates and sell the extra power. \\\\if  Vivint refuses to remove the panels, I will have to go to court which I hate.  This has been a nightmare and incredibly stressful.  I was so excited to get solar.  I has turned out terribly from the very start and will be an incredible burden.  Yes, experience has been very disappointing.",

It was emphasized on more than one occasion by my salesman that Vivint would need to inspect my roof to make sure that it was suitable for solar. \\\\Why did the Vivint inspector give me an enthusiastic thumbs up regarding my roof and never mention the obvious problems?  Is this guy a real inspector?  \\\\The condition of my roof was obvious once it was pointed out to me by three professional roofing contractors.   Now I cringe every time it looks like rain.  There is even a bubble in the paint in my master bedroom from moisture (obviously coming from the roof).",

I was only alerted to this fact after receiving enormous power bills from SMECO.  The technician was originally scheduled to come out earlier but failed to show up for that original appointment.  When I contacted the call center, the appointment was rescheduled for nearly a month out, leaving good summer months of solar collection lost  When he did come out, mysteriously the system started to work but he was not able to tell me why the system was not working, how long the system has not been working, if this issue will continue or re-occur and lastly, why, if Vivint is monitoring the system, why Vivint didn't alert me of this matter.  There  needs to be more service technicians so that you don't have to wait nearly a month for an appointment and their needs to be better monitoring of the system and an alert to both the homeowner and the monitoring center.  I am the homeowner association liaison for my area and many of the residents are considering solar power, however they are waiting on my personal assessment of my experience after a year of service.  To date, after this experience, I am unsure if my system is truly working and if I am getting the savings I was promised.\\Thank you",

Then roof leaks that took 8 months to get settled and not being notified for 4 months that my system was not talking with vivint and you were estimating service instead of be productive and fixing the issue.

After turning it back on he determined that there is a problem with one of the panels and he can't reactivate the system until that has been resolved.  It's kinda a mess and not one we had anything to do with, so we are a bit unhappy right now.

When I called Vivant about the problem, I had to wait approx. 10 days before anyone could come to look at it to see if it were the solar panels or something else.  In the meantime, we got more rain!    When Vivant  came to finally inspect the roof, attic and master bathroom (which was just  repaired from another leak, freshly painted and a new light fixture installed), they did come to the conclusion that the solar panel footings were the problem and they did repair it on the roof.  They were all set to leave, until I reminded them that the insulation was mildew ridden and I didn't' want to put that back since it was just repaired from another issue we had. So they did go to Home Depot to replace the old, but left it up there for added insulation.  But I am really not happy since our ceiling had water damage as well as the wall that was just freshly painted 1 month ago!",

Nobody bithrred to inform us that the system wasnt connecting and all they could say was sorry they were understaffed. It made me so angry. When I called vivint they gave me the runaround and made lame excuses. So disappointing! I am extremely unhappy wiyh vivint and am looking for ways to break free of this stupid contract.

The flashing / skirt they installed on the edge of the panels still left between six and eight inches between the panels and the roof, and this became a great place for pigeons to nest.

I called many times about the problem and all I get is the same bullshit answer like its some kind of joke.  Well you signed the papers.  That all you assholes keep saying. So to be honest I will never say anything good about your company to anybody I know.  In fact I tell people to stay away from your company . I have had so many phone calls with the office that's in my neighborhood and supposedly I was speaker to the manager and explained everything . They set up a meeting and then don't show up.  Then they show the next day and act like well we here now so what you wanna do.  Another time we spoke with somebody at the office they tell me that we will get back to you sir and they never do.  As far as I'm concerned I want your shit off my roof so I can go back to how it was before with Hawaiian Electric.  At least they are honest about shit and they take care of business. I realize that the person reading that had nothing to do with all this bullshit and I apologize if you get affended with what I said but you guys did ask how you where doing.",

            "I was very disappointed with the promise that when we signed the contract that my panels are monitored remotely and that if something were to happen a technician would be dispatched to handle the repair and we'd be notified. 9 of my panels stopped working at some point in June or July and I was never notified. Once I noticed a drastic problem with my electric bill and solar bill for August and September I called to schedule a service and find out what had happened. That was when I was informed that there was an issue that wasn't addressed. I was scheduled for an appointment in October almost a month later, which was then canceled because they said 2 technicians had to do the work. That appointment was rescheduled for another month later. The work was done on the panels on November 22nd. I requested a phone call prior to technicians showing up due to the large window of time I was given and the need to take my children to school and pick them up because of the holiday schedule. The technicians never called and showed up as I was leaving. I was gone for 10 minutes and they set up a ladder and went to work. I asked them to let me know if they needed anything or to let me know when they were set. About 30 minutes later I looked outside and they were gone. No notice to let me know if the work has been completed, what was done, if I should contact customer service, nothing. I was very disappointed in the amount of time that this process took for something that seemed to only take a few minutes to fix and was made out to be a big ordeal. I have yet to receive a call from the company as well as I was promised that when the work was complete to make credit adjustments to my bills because of the timeframe I was without most of the services that I was promised. I will be following up with customer service very soon and hope for a better experience and some compensation for the lack of service.",

Also, I wasn't even notified when they were complete so I was inside the home waiting for a knock at the door letting me know what had happened, and if there were further steps that needed to be handled. In less than 30 minutes they were gone without any notification.",

BUT the last time someone from Vivint came out we were on vacation and my neighbor asked him what he was doing and he said it was ok because he talked to me.  I never talked to him & didn't know he was coming.  When I got home I found a message on my answering machine (I guess your serviceman thought he was talking to me  when he left a message).  I have left instructions that anyone on my property w/o permission is to be reported to the Fresno County Sheriff as trespassing.  And when I signed up for solar I was told I would be able to monitor my solar production on line.  This must have been the same as when I was told it would take weeks to install but it turned into months to get the parts (and installed in one day) and more months thru the hot summer to wait for it to be turned on.  You operated like a one horse show, when you are a huge company that rides on a few perfect jobs and doesn't care how long it takes to get  the job done for the bulk of the customers as long as you can sell the people on how good you are.  When my friends and relatives ask how come it is taking so long and why haven't they turned on the system.  Word of mouth sells product, but failures and lies stops it.  I had people ready to sign up with you, but your performance on my home destroyed that.  You have no one to blame but yourselves.",
