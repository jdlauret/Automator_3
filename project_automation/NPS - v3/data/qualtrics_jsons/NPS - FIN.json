When your worker came back, he informed me that there was \"no need\" for me to have a copy. When he told me he would be uploading the documents later that day, I asked him to send me a copy since they were going to be digitally stored anyway. He said there was no reason for me to have a copy. I asked him to send me them anyway. He said that wasn't necessary. Never saw them again. Great Experience! NOT.",

Then argued with me month later when I called to find out why I'm still waiting.  He kept saying he sent me email it would take up to 19 weeks.  That was first time I heard that.  I guess he's right it will be 19 weeks or longer.  My last call when I admit to be very short with person I requested a call back right away and she agreed.  Well, I'm still waiting for that call.

Here we are in the holiday season of 2017 and still no working solar hookup.  We have been told everything is good  but is it?  We hear from you about once a month. I believe our original contract said solar completion by Oct. Are we going to be able to put up holiday lights and use our solar?  We have not left the house to take a vacation so we have been here.  It's your company that has let us down.  We have had friends go with other solar companies and they were only  a few months from beginning to end of completion. My husband's clients have begun to ask for tax appointments and by the way \"are you on solar yet?\"    We have to say \"no\".   My husband said that someone left a message  and said they would send us an email onhow to turn on our solar but we have yet to hear anything. . and what's up with an email??? Please Please Please get this taken care of .  We are entering tax continuing ed season and we will be leaving the house periodically. We certainly don't wnat to miss you as it seems you have a really really busy schedule.  Now YOU tell us HOW YOU ARE DOING?",

In the mean time I called that day to get more info on what was happening and was told you would find out what was happening and call me back to confirm. I did not receive any call until the day of my new appointment. I was called at 8:30 and was told I had a morning visit and the first inspector would be there at 9:30 followed by the second inspector at 10. By 12 there was still no inspector at my home. I called to see what was happening, again Vivant had no real information. I received a call from the inspector that said he would be to my home within the next hour. The first in septic arrived around 1 and did what he needed to in my home but had to wait outside for about 30 minutes for the other inspector to show up. I expected this to be a smoother process. Taking 2 days off work was not necessary considering they took about 5 minutes to inspect what was done previously by your company.",

When I mentioned that we had discussed an afternoon appointment the person I spoke with didn\u2019t seem to know anything about that.  I understand that there is coordination for an inspection but there had been several conversations about the afternoon time.  The day in general was not good for us but I wanted to accommodate since they were in my county that day.  I had made arrangements for my son to help if needed but I was not home that day & my husband would only be home in the afternoon.  It would have been better if I had at least been notified that the afternoon time could not be accommodated.

However, after dealing with your company after the solar panels were installed has been frustrating.  Its been almost 4-5 months after install that we are still not on solar.  There needs to be better partnership with PG&E and city officials and better communication internally within your company!  There were a few times where the work order schedule had conflicts and nobody showed up from your office.  I hope i made a good decision going with your company, and i hope that in the future your company will be more proactive and more professional like Jason Von Flue.  Thank you",

            "stop lying to your customer.  I was told that we could be installed before the end of the year.  Well, installed to Vivant means useless equipment on your roof.  Installed to me means working equipment.  Then then we experienced a problem with system design and capacity to install every step of the way.  I was informed that there was a problem with the available amperage available at the breaker box.  I was assured that Vivant would make sure that I had at least 175amp to the breaker box.  We discussed the various ways that Vivant would make sure that would be the case.  In the end they installed a 125amp bus breaker to pass inspection and I was told that an outside breaker box with 175-200 amp would be installed to both meet my request to make sure I would continue to have that level of amperage (started with 200amp) Instead after we passed inspection Vivant came out and removed the necessary breaker to pass inspection and left me with 200 amp but with a system that will not pass county code inspection.  Then I was told that there would be one month between an operating system and the first payment do to Mossaic so that we would not have to pay essentially a double payment.  15 days after power own my first payment is due.  So, not only will I have a $205 bill due to the power company I will owe Mossaic $185 the same day.  Then the second month I'll have a half month of electric supplied by the power company and a full payment to Mossaic.  LIES!!!  and more LIES!!!  \\\\At this point I feel that I am owed a breaker box with the proper amperage that passes code and approximately $350 to go towards an electric bill or a delay of another month before my Mossaic payment is due.  If this doesn't happen I will have to consider calling the county for inspection of the system and possibly an attorney.  I really do not want to do either of those things but I can't understand why Vivant would continue to lie to me.  At one point your salesman threatened to stop talking to me (yet he wanted the install to continue) because he was mad that I was angry and yelling about the fact that every time the install people came out I was getting fed a line about how they weren't going to be able to do what they told me they would do.  Makes sense.  Vivant screws up and I'm the bad guy for being upset.\\\\As customers we deserve better treatment and honesty.",

Twice the installers came out and twice they left without doing the install. Each time I was told someone from giving would contact me. Months went by without anyone contacting me. At the end of 2017 I  am contacted by giving about doing an add on. They have no answers about what happened between January and November.  Once installed I am told someone from vivint will bring the papers on inspection day. On inspection day no one from vivint shows up and I fail the inspection.  Vivint schedules another inspection but doesn't tell me. The right hand has no idea what the left hand is doing. A very frustrating situation.",

Not sure how long it will take for Edison to get the results and give the OK to turn it on.  Overall, install crew was great.  Did a clean good looking install.

The most recent set back was when Mosaic deducted money from my bank account as loan for panels when i had clearly instructed the vivint representative that i was not interested in purchasing the panels with a loan from mosaic and had opted for the government free installment program. I contacted vivint representative in Dec 2017, prior to mosaic deducting money, requesting him to look into the matter as i had received a notice from mosaic that they would deduct money in January 2018. The delay by vivint caused in mosaic deducting money from my bank account. It is almost end of January and i have still not received the refund of the wrongly deducted money nor confirmation that the records have been rectified to reflect that i am not taking any loans from mosaic. \\\\i am sure that the paper work for my solar panels were wrongly submitted by the vivint representative and to my surprise, i dont even have access to complain about him. When i called the vivint customer service seeking to complain about the representative, i was directed to contact him and was told that he is the only person who will be able to help me.  i feel helpless since i am unable to approach anyone but the person who has kept making errors throughout the process of this project. I would appreciate if someone took my case a little seriously and can help me resolve this error. \\\\Thanks\\Tehsin Aurangabadwala",

I had to take a day off from work in order to get things fixed every time it failed, thus causing me inconvenience specially financially. \\\\I wish things were done correctly and were well communicated.",

I was also told by a customer representative 2/11/2018, that Vivint was waiting for my power company to send them something after the net meter was installed. I spoke with a supervisor at the power company who advised that he has been working in the net meter department for 20 years and they never send anything to the solar company, he even provided me with an email stating the same thing. He told me that since we have 40 panels that can produce 11.6KW that my 7600KW inverter is too small. He said that since my system is over 10KW they are going to come to my home this week and confirm that my investor is too small. SolarEdge advised me that it is too small as well. He also explained that they sell power at 11 cents per KW hour and they pay 5 cents per KW hour when we over produce. I have also not been granted access to my site and the monitoring portal, my AR number or job number 5844725. I need access to my dashboard and layout. Please contact me ASAP to set-up an appointment to come and install the correct inverter for my system and make things right or I will be drafting letters to my local senators, congressman, and attorney general to let them know what has been happening to me when I have a loan for over $41K for a system that is supposed to supply all our power needs and over produce. I have read all the reviews about how your company has done this same thing to many of your customers all over the country. If I was to bet, you will be out of business in the next couple of years do to your questionable business practices. I look forward to hearing back very soon. Josh",

We are now 7 months later , I still have to wait for our electric company to change out the meter and I have found it very difficult  to get any answers to questions  from your local representatives. I had spoken to    Philip Chamberlain, at the time he seemed most concerned about what was going on  and said he would get back to me by the end of that day. I did call him back , left a message no return call.  I n the past I have reached out to the original rep.with whom we delt during the buying process , he stopped at the house  one day, left a note saying he would stop again ( that was  January  3rd) Have not seen or heard from him  since.  I think this speaks very poorly of your customer service and honestly wish I had never embarked on this installation with VIVINT. My experience has been totally negative and since my husband and I did buy the solar system and now we are  paying for the loan along with our regular electric bill I am very upset. WE WOULD APPRECIATE  A RESPONSE TO THIS NOTE.  There are several other things that have occurred  in this process that I would  certainly  like to discuss.  Kathleen  Dreyer",

He said they knew that. then they went ahead and installed to the wrong house anyway! The other solar company was alerted and they decided the best way to handle this was to put both houses on one meter! Turns out we didn't need your system at all! Your rep told  us we didn't have enough panels. Turns out we already had enough panels for both houses! This project has been going on for 1 year and 3 months. I find that outrageous! Even filing the application to Edison after supposedly the last inspection was screwed up and had to be redone! I don't care if your system here is ever turned on. I certainly would never recommend your company. It seems it is run with the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing!",

To the NUMEROUS people who have assured me I would be called back - which never happened.
