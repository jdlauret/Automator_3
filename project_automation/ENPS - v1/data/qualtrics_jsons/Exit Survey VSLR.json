I would have come up with a solution well before the utilities votes and changed net metering. Also, leadership structure is not conducive to keeping good employees. Good employees in sales will leave and find other opportunities to be able to manage and not knock doors and have a family life. Knocking on Saturdays and nights is not good for anyone with kids in school. You need a management structure that allows salesmen to move up, off the doors and establish a lasting career. With the structure now, you will either get burnt out and quit after makin good money, or find another employer who values your time and will allow you to spend it where it matters.

Being that I would not install Vivint on my own home, I could not in good conscience sell them to anyone else. I noticed this when other companies accomplished better results in same or smaller roof areas. I am probably six months away from installing on my own home and if Vivint were to have higher wattage panels in that time frame I would gladly consider installing on my home and explore returning as a salesperson.",

Had there been a realistic part-time work option, I would have kept working at Vivint. As it stands, though, I would have had to do a full 40 hours worth of units of work in the 20 hours of time I had available - in other words, 0.875 units/hour, or Tier 8 production. During my time there I discovered that people only rarely actually receive a raise for higher tier production despite promises to the contrary (another reason I was dissatisfied), so realistically, I would likely only be paid for Tier 1 or Tier 2 production despite having to do Tier 8 work to keep the job. In other words, I'd be asked to do a full 40 hours of work, in half the time, and for only 20 hours of pay. As this would be a pretty horrible arrangement for me, I decided my best option was to quit and seek other part time work, despite how much I loved my job as a PV designer.",

            "I was hired while Sales Process 1.5 was still being used, so I was given the employee handbook for the old system, and the training pay system under that sales process is what I understood and agreed to be what I would be receiving. The week I started was the week Sales Process 2.0 was implemented, and I was not informed of the new training pay system under Sales Process 2.0. In my opinion, the training pay system under Sales process 2.0 makes it nearly impossible to get paid (besides the first payment for generating one lead) until many weeks into training. After the first payment of $750 which is received from generating one lead, in order to receive the next payments you must achieve a welcome call. This essentially means that you have to have a customer agreeing to and signing off on a CAD design for their house by week two, in order to receive consistent pay. This is basically impossible for many reasons. As a new sales rep, you do not have the skills or knowledge to get a customer to the level of understanding and comfort where they are agreeing to a CAD. Also, in general, people need much more time than 2 weeks to make a decision along the lines of putting solar panels on their roof. While nothing is binding until the panels are on the roof, people may be very hesitant to approve anything like a CAD design that quickly. Also, it is often difficult to even schedule a CAD presentation appointment. I generated a lead on my first week, but couldn't even get a CAD presentation scheduled until 4 weeks later. This was just due to the customer being a busy person, but I faced the penalty for it. Overall, I firmly believe the training pay system needs completely restructured. This system does not allow sales reps to support themselves during training, and that is crucial to encouraging employees to stay.",

I think a higher pay would have made the bad culture of Vivint Solar more bearable.  I don't think much could be done about the culture of Vivint Solar overall, since it was changing in ways that were not good for anyone besides the salesmen and electricians.  Everyone else is kind of stuck in their department with little to no opportunity for advancement or raises.  As much as my supervisors were saying over and over how it is possible to get a raise, what I actually saw and heard from other employees showed that these goals were impossible.  I had seen my direct supervisor get demoted, and multiple departments dissolved.  It was incredibly frustrating to be told that there was so much opportunity for a career with Vivint Solar when the actions of the company seemed to go directly against that.  Ultimately for 12.50/hr, which most companies start out at, it was not worth having to deal with the culture.  Everyone I worked with was miserable and complacent, and I needed something better.",

I think if the base pay for a designer went up to at least 15+/hr, then I would gladly consider coming back.  It would make the 40 minute commute acceptable. I wouldn't be barely scraping by paycheck to paycheck.  It would make the constantly changing culture bearable.",

Another issue is that the surveyors are required to carry a lot of heavy equipment in a very unsafe and cumbersome backpack onto each roof. I now have a herniated disc and a bulging disc that I will have to live with for the rest of my life. There is no doubt that These injuries are the direct result of carrying and setting up that 32' ladder by myself or that backpack. The job is simply unsafe and caused me serious injury. I am suffering with my back every day and I'm only 46 years old. On top of all of the pain and suffering I am enduring, the claims adjuster that I was dealing with was a very nasty woman. She was nasty from the start, I did every single thing asked of me, and she was STILL nasty.

Problem employees that were high on prescription drugs and other drugs everyday and still scheduled to work with me the next day after the manager was made aware of the situation. Also not immediately being told i would be fired and not to expect to have a job when I come back from military service that I was called for. For a company that touts how they want to hire veterans and all this crap that was pretty low and ultimately the final straw. My manager openly complained when I had to take off a Saturday to perform military duties. I used pto to be present for my military duties even though I didn't have to. I would always here from other employees how my manager was trying to find ways to get rid of me because my military schedule was getting in the way of his schedule. The worst part though is still that two different managers at both locations I worked at openly knew of drug and alcohol use on the job and would do nothing about it and still try to hound us about safety. How can I take someone seriously who does that? It is counterintuitive. This company has a very apparent trend of putting people in positions in which they do not have the experience, knowledge or capacity to handle. Namely the management.",

I found a job making more than what I made at vivint with in one week of looking. My current employer does not create an environment where employees are made to feel as if they are being held hostage by the amount they get paid. Or hold employees pay rate and job security above their head in order to coerce employees into doing sub par slammed together work or things that are morally unethical. At my current job I feel as though my opinion matters and I am actually being paid for what I bring to the table rather than as a hostage to do what I'm told (even if it's wrong)  or I will face adverse action.",

I understand it was a commission only sales position, but I was 100% lost from day one and as a former sales manager myself, I would never do this to a new employee/rep.   I really wanted to stay and think the company would be a great fit but nobody seemed to care one iota and I did not want to be cast in a sink or swim position at this juncture of my career.  I would love to get another opportunity with a new manager.  Again, my manager Logan was a very nice guy and obviously very good at what he does.  He just had too many personal issues he was going through and was in no way, shape or form in a position to help me.  I do not need much hand holding, but to receive absolutely zero guidance or help is just not a very good first impression.  Thank you.",

When knocking doors and having a homeowner interested it would be nice to sit and have a PowerPoint presentation that the salesman can point to. Not show them all pages, but just what is necessary during the conversation. Trainers were tired of doing that job every week, most likely not getting paid for it. But they were burnt and without the mood of training any new person. They would break us in groups to teach us something and then tell one of the guys to teach the rest and they would just leave or watch, when they were supposed to do it. If we were independent then they should not push us to open accounts as competition between teams, because then we were not really qualifying people accordingly.",

The  pressure and not understood but the supervisor urge me to pause. I needed an income as I have 5 children and a LDS. But i needed more time to balance between Vivint and a job the would help pay the bills right the way. I really love the team but i could not give up my family needs. I needed time and Vivint Denver wanted more time. They are great people but maybe their needs to be number 1 to them was greater than family needs. Sorry to say all that.

I left for a company that had no problem seeing my value and gave me a higher salary. \\\\2. Unlimited PTO only benefits employees that fall far below the chain of management. I was in a position where I could hardly ever take time off because I was expected to take my computer with me everywhere so that I could send out a report at any hour of the day/night. \\\\3. High stress atmosphere, with little reward. There were too many times where unplanned needed reports resulted in me staying past midnight to finish it, or having to get up very early in the morning to send out an \"urgent report\".",

Research has shown that pay is not the biggest factor that keeps people around at a company. People want to feel like their employer has some kind of investment into them. i.e. tuition reimbursement, investment classes teaching people how to spend their money now that they make more than they ever have, stuff like that. Guys like Ty Williams, Taylor Turnbull, Devin Arp, were all good with stuff like that and because I knew them personally I was able to ask their advice but it would be cool if there was a corporate program for that kind of stuff.",

            "Honestly, there could have been a lot. I think the biggest frustration I had was the training. The training was terrible, and it did not prepare me for the tasks I needed to perform. Out of the entire group I got hired with, there was about 4 or 5 people that lasted. I'm surprised I lasted the time I did. While I had worked there, I had so many questions that my managers would be annoyed and would treat me as inferior because of my questions. I didn't like that the managers would play favorites...If my co-worker had a question, they would simply answer it...If I had a questions, that would treat me like an idiot, as if I SHOULD know what the answer was. They would always respond in a rhetorical question such as, \"Well what do YOU think the answer is??\" But yeah, the training was lack luster at best. I mean, they did a good job on letting us know what the Solar products do, but for every 7 phone calls out of 10 there would be a customer calling with a question that I have never been trained on...a lot of times I was accidentally giving out false information simply because of the lack of training and knowledge. The other thing I didn't like was that the job was not very flexible. Every 2 weeks you would get 3 whole hours of time off. As someone who has another job that requires me to travel, it made it nearly impossible to live outside of work...it just felt like I was a slave there. Anyways, to sum it all up as the reasons why I left: 1 - Lack of training, 2 - Poor management and leadership skills, 3 - lack of flexibility to get time off. \\\\I did like the food though. I definitely miss the sushi there.",

Commission sales are tough enough. But when one is trying to brake into a new profession and you have to sell for someone else before you make anything isn\u2019t inducive to a good working environment to new employees. There were 3 of us that were starting there and he was demanding the same from all of us. The toughest part of it all was his supervisor agreed with him. Well I could make 300 thousand a year sending unwitting newly hired people out to do my sales for me to!! Just a real crappy thing to do to new people. Kind of like a revolving door of new hires sent in to do Andy\u2019s job sense he can\u2019t to make him look like someone he\u2019s not.

            "It is difficult to say what lead to my termination, but there are several observations I would like to share.\\1. Management at the Santa Fe office definitely is outstanding in all areas pertaining to sales. On the other hand, they know very little about operational aspects of running an office and people management.\\2. There is little or no communication between the managers on important subject matters. The lead manager, in my case, was not aware that I was terminated by another manager. Another example, with my superior knowledge in all aspects relating to solar energy and solar installations, I approached the lead manager and offered to bring a representative for Owens Corning roofing materials to teach the sales team everything about roofing. The lead manager was enthusiastic about the opportunity to teach the sales staff about roofs and seconded my effort. On the day of the presentation he was not present and another manager was in charge. This manger had not been briefed, even though the topic was mentioned in two meetings and staff was encouraged to attend the training session. The manager had different plans for the meeting and completely ignored the Owens Corning representative for over one hour. My efforts to correct this were rudely dismissed. Finally the manager spoke to the rep from Owens Corning and told him that everyone in the sales team knows about roofs and that he was not needed. Not only was this extremely rude towards the Owens Corning rep who just wasted two hours of his time, it was also untrue that sales staff know all about roofs because most of the staff had been on board for only a few weeks.\\3. Considering the requirement of using computer programs designed exclusively for the Apple operating system, Vivint should be able to assist those employees without Apple devices to acquire such at reduced rates. Vivint employs a huge sales force and would be in a position to negotiate excellent terms with Apple. I don't have an I-Pad and do not have a budget to readily purchase one. Management should be in a position to arrange for people like me to obtain an I-Pad either by loaning a company I-Pad or by tapping into Vivint resources to make it possible for the sales rep to work properly and efficiently. Because of my inability to close my generated leads, I had a very poor performance. The causality between the two was known to management.",
            "23",
            "I have no yet decided on a new company and I regret having been terminated by my office. However, I will be looking for a company that offers a base salary and, should that be required, the necessary tools for me to execute my work. \\Incidentally, the $ 6,000 sign up Vivint bonus is misleading on several levels and has been criticized by many in the sales staff. If Vivint wants to retain top representatives, Vivint should focus more on fairness and respect. If not, Vivint will burn through a lot of talent. In the short term the present approach might be successful, but in the long run it will fail. The solar market is becoming increasingly competitive and that spells trouble for companies focusing on short term gain. Ultimately shareholder value will be affected too.",

The two occasions I did knock doors with someone (not the same person both times), neither one got to the point of a sit down.  I asked several times to knock with someone else to see the entire process, but no one was willing to assist.  During my employment with Vivint I had 8 sit downs, 4 had proposals, but only one made it through to install.  3 of my proposals (2 loan) failed because I couldn't get questions answered within 48 hours (often didn't get a response at all and had to ask at the next meeting) by my managers or captain through phone calls or text.  The major reason why I quit is the very poor/non-existent communication that I received from my managers and captain.",

            "Brian Brooker was my manager and supervisor and one of the most corrupt individuals I have ever worked for. But because he was A Vivint high producer he was allowed to get away with shady leadership and business practices.  I watched him remove sales agents from areas that had large roof sizes in order to line his own pockets. I also saw him hoard corporate leads for himself instead of giving them out to the team.    He freely fired people who were trying their best to make sales and I personally know of four people on our team who were let go or fired so that his numbers would look good for corporate.  I also watched him sell solar systems from underneath people on the sales team. I know of one agent who lost four sales to Brian Brooker. I also recorded video of him teaching us how to lie to customers to get the sale.  I wouldn't cross the street to shake his hand.  \\\\But I would swim through shark infested waters to work for Tim Clarkson. Tim was the consummate professional, was interested in developing the talents of the team and genuinely had everyone's best interest in mind. I'm sad that he has had to leave Concord California and move to Chico California to get away from Brian Brooker",

Was promised I could work from home while in the end stages of my pregnancy and was also able to come back to work following the birth of my child. Out of the blue I was fired basically. Wasn't able to get maternity leave or unemployment.  I had no money coming in to provide for my child.  During my employment I would have to beg for my weekly check which was promised every Friday and most days I wouldn't even get it until the following Monday morning. I have been struggling ever since. This manager has lied to a lot of people about pay and money. I believe that he needs to be looked into. During my employment they're we're multiple clients complaining that they were promised a refund check and never received it. As soon as the solar was installed this manger would go MIA on them. \\I will be seeking legal advice on this matter.",

I once was working with a foreclosed home and the banker was trying to get the panels removed.  He had proactively worked as hard as he could and early enough for us to remove the panels, but because he was \"not a customer\" he didn't take top priority and that resulted in him losing thousands of dollars.  If we as a company want to be showing how much we care for people and the community of the world in going green, I don't care who you are, we should be trying to work with whomever smoothly and quickly if its in regards to our panels.  Instead, a great guy who worked with me for a couple of months now has a bad experience because he wasn't a \"priority.\"",

            "Matt Jackson is unfit for any supervisory role whatsoever. He creates a negative work environment with threats. He takes out his stress and his own inadequacies on employees around him. He acts as if he has no managerial experience whatsoever in dealing with crew. Unprofessional, abusive, racist, sexist, poor morals, poor ethics, uncaring attitude. He simply tells his bosses whatever they want to hear and takes out his shortcomings on crews who are overworked already.\\Corey Phelps is a crew lead who recently moved from Albuquerque to the recently reopened Hawaii location, he is equally abusive, domineering, has anger management issues, and, although I believe he is not in a supervisory role any longer he should not be allowed back into that position due to his threatening and unsafe work practices.\\Both individuals are pushing unsafe work practices by putting up an illusion of conforming with safety standards only when the safety inspector for the company, Michael Kennerson is in town. Crew leads have set up a private chat app with other crew leads across the country with Vivint solar employees to warn others when the safety inspector is in town. They force crews to work through unsafe conditions such as high wind speeds, rain, lightning, excessive heat With No Breaks Allowed, and other safety conditions in which company standards would not allow us to work on that rooftop. OSHA requires access to a restroom such as a porta potty on each job site, we never had one on any of our job sites. Even though we were told not to, we are forced to urinate in bottles in the back of the company truck in order to not offend the customer buy them seeing us urinating Outdoors. You are expected to drive the company truck to a restroom at a gas station miles away if you need other facilities. Anchors for safety ropes are installed for looks and not into studs as required. This is due to pressure by the company to hurry up and get the job done. Putting up safety ropes and taking them down takes more than an hour sometimes which the bosses would not allow. On tile roofs, Anchor Points are not sealed according to Rocky's standards. They think it takes too long. They just fill the holes in with sealant and reinstall the anchor bolts. They say this is good enough. They forced us to carry extremely heavy items such as solar panels up ladders up to three stories tall, claiming safer methods take too long. We do not have Skylight guards in our warehouse even though it is company policy to install those on each skylight, never seen one, seen dozens of skylights though. We install on roof pitches that are Beyond the company's safety standards, too steep. We install panels on rooftops that have shading issues when there is plenty of space in the yard for a pole mount system with no shading issues. Solar panel should not be installed on roofs with any shading issues, that shows me the salesmen are just being greedy. They are also being pressured from the top to sell any job no matter what the cost, we install on unsafe rotting rooftops, then we get sued for leaks and take more than a year to fix it, all of this from pressure from the top to make sales with no concern for installing solar correctly. It is all about the numbers increasing. Forcing two and sometimes three jobs per day is unsafe and not fair to the customer for a quality installation. Vivint solar is being sued in New Mexico and multiple States for damage to homes and rooftops where solar panel should never have been installed in the first place. Salesman are threatened to sell anything or risk being fired, crews compete with productivity numbers to see who is the fastest with no concern for safety, quality, or or building a photovoltaic system the way you would want one installed on your house. I believe all of this and Vivnt's negative image to the public are contributing to the downfall of photovoltaic sales from other, good companies.  People want solar but they don't want Vivint to come and ruin their house and not fix it fast enough. They want to feed back into the grid andpay off their panels and own them. Vivint can't do that. They want to have solar power when the grid is down, Vivint can't do that. They want a pole mount array out in their yard and not damage their nice roof, Vivint can't do that. Customers I have talked to said Vivint put leaks in the roof, gave them a second power bill, and they pay the same for electricity they paid before, now they just have to pay it to two different places. Vivint installs all Chinese products. This is bad for the United States economy. Vivint solar has proven to me that it is more concerned with profit then it is with photovoltaics and the health and safety of its employees.",

There was some tech issue. Bryce put a lot of pressure on me to go out selling every day but then never got me set up so I could go out selling. I drove from slc to vivint 3 times total and still wasn't fully signed up and able to begin selling. Bryce never got back to me when he said he would, and he still wanted me to come in for weekly sales meetings even though he hadn't got me signed up yet. Very frustrating.

You need to give much better price flexibility, customers hate escalators.  \\\\Lower requirements, I lost 150k in commissions to rival companies because your credit requirement is higher than everyone else's.\\\\And your customer service post PTO is atrocious.   If a system does not work, it takes months to diagnose it, and up to a year to compensate the customer if at all.\\\\This summer I got several customers complain to me about lack of production, due to system failures.  I felt that Vivint made me look dishonest to my customers, with their lack of competence.\\\\And most importantly Vivint is way behind the competition with challenging markets.  Vivint is the only solar company to exit Phoenix.  I don't believe your partnership with Mercedes Benz will last very long if processes are not fixed, and I'll be frankly surprised if Vivint is still in business 5 years from now.\\\\So triple your pay, get better much better streamlined process, lower your credit qualifications.

I was shuffled around to three different hotels as reservations were only set in days, not even weeks, let alone months as I was told. Training was less than lackluster. I had zero on-the-job training of doors. There were some in-office training exercises, but most time was wasted among the boys club. Finally, my team was told we would be working in one office/area which we had visited and really enjoyed. The team was team-oriented and in the area of which we wanted to live.

So the change I would suggest, is create a way for your new employee's to stick around long enough to gain the skills necessary to succeed. I realize that it isn't as cost effective to pay your new sales agents in order to get them by. However, what kind of culture are you trying to create. Do you want all your new employees to stick around and not be in fear of if they are going to make rent; or do you want to create a supporting environment in which you foster talent long enough to become fully mature.

Like so many, We are excited and eager to learn the process so that we can get out there a make money. However, the setter/closer program that management designed in Florida was a scheme. Sales reps should be trained to close and have several experiences to learn before being sent out. Management makes all the money by closing all the deals for new people. Those people after months of waiting for their money to come in, quit and then management takes all of it. I feel so bad for all the sales reps that were taken advantage of. I dont think this was managements plan. Ownership set it up this way so that management is able to make money. In the Florida market you're being squashed by so many companies who put glass on the house in 30 days vs. Vivint's 60 - 90 days. You guys already know all this and you already know all the problems your facing in Florida. So im not sure why im even taking 3-4 minutes to write this.",

            "After careful thought and consideration, I have concluded that my core values are not aligned with the organizational \"culture\" at Vivint Solar. It is time to move on to maintain my health, sanity, and overall happiness. This letter is to officially inform you that I resign from my position as a Warehouse Lead and Warehouse Specialist immediately. This letter also serves as my exit interview. The biggest challenge at Vivint Solar would stem from a lack of effective systems. However, I quickly realized that inflated egos, office politics, and administrative incompetence would prove to be bigger obstacles. These dynamics were not conducive to productivity. I was deprived of a heathy work and life balance. I did not receive fair gratitude for the work I was held accountable for by myself, even after going above and beyond what was required from a Warehouse Lead/Warehouse Specialist while still maintaining optimal statistics. Additionally, I have been reprimanded and questioned from management above my Supervisor. False claims were made regarding my work performance. I hardly think that a statement from one person that can not execute any position under himself, constitutes a concrete fact. Once it was admitted that the idea of promoting was only being held over my head, I left because I absolutely refuse to promote under such selfish and close minded ignorance. Without vision, there is no successful outcome. My future means more to me than to deal with any person of higher management that is Ignoramus. Nevertheless, from the time I transferred from Operations to Supply Chain, my immediate supervisor has been nothing but helpful and supportive.

I\u2019m positive my experience isn\u2019t an isolated one. The lack of employee engagement and satisfaction are enough evidence of to prove the inability to attract, create, and retain talent.

Unfortunately, it became abundantly clear to me that my integrity would be pushed to the edge, due to the unethical circumstances I endured with the overlooked and prolonged overtime. I could continue to share more for the purposes of an exit interview, but I have little faith that information gathered would be compiled to formulate a retention strategy. Please let me know what to expect as far as my paid time off and my employee benefits. IF I can be of assistance during this immediate transition, Xtisin Denney may contact me.

            "After careful thought and consideration, I have concluded that my core values are not aligned with the organizational \"culture\" at Vivint Solar. It is time to move on to maintain my health, sanity, and overall happiness. This letter is to officially inform you that I resign from my position as a Warehouse Lead and Warehouse Specialist immediately. This letter also serves as my exit interview. The biggest challenge at Vivint Solar would stem from a lack of effective systems. However, I quickly realized that inflated egos, office politics, and administrative incompetence would prove to be bigger obstacles. These dynamics were not conducive to productivity. I was deprived of a heathy work and life balance. I did not receive fair gratitude for the work I was held accountable for by myself, even after going above and beyond what was required from a Warehouse Lead/Warehouse Specialist while still maintaining optimal statistics. Additionally, I have been reprimanded and questioned from management above my Supervisor. False claims were made regarding my work performance. I hardly think that a statement from one person that can not execute any position under himself, constitutes a concrete fact. Once it was admitted that the idea of promoting was only being held over my head, I left because I absolutely refuse to promote under such selfish and close minded ignorance. Without vision, there is no successful outcome. My future means more to me than to deal with any person of higher management that is Ignoramus. Nevertheless, from the time I transferred from Operations to Supply Chain, my immediate supervisor has been nothing but helpful and supportive.

            "I worked there for 3 years. When i started there it was $10.50/hour, in that first year i worked really hard to earn my raises, about the time i got to $12.50/hour we changed the base pay up to 12.50 starting. This was a bit frustrating for me because i had worked hard to make earn more. After a month or so i decided that i would just have to earn those raises again. At this point i had worked in 7 different offices including Piloting Arizona, the commercial solar project and san diego (at the time the largest and most difficult) trained 8 new designers 4 of which went on to be leads and 1 to be supervisor, was nominated for employee of the month 3 times and for the BAD CAD award twice (which doesnt exist anymore but was an award for a design with the most modules and difficulty of house). I had applied for multiple lead positions but in the end would be passed up, twice just due to scheduling issues. Then after 3 years and for most of this was going out of my way to aid the department (especially training) and in 3 years i recieved 0 compensation or even notice, and even with recomendations from leads and supervisors there was no compensation. In tandum they ruined scheduling which forced me to do full time work and full time school, eventually i became too stressed to function well in either. So i decided to leave. I have always supported Vivint solar and still do. The company is moving forward and making good progress, not perfect but good. It seems to me that certain people or positions in the company head are loosing site of who was really keeping them up there. There just seemed to be a lack of care, all replaced with neglect.",

            "When I started, there was a lot of talk about autonomy, we would be allowed to do what we want between calls when the call flow was slow, things like listen to music, watch Netflix, etc. as long as it didn't interfere with calls. Soon after, that was not the case anymore. The longer I was employed, the less autonomy I had, and the more my time was micro-managed. If i had a question, I could reach out through chat or ask in person and get an answer within a few seconds, then the policy changed, we couldn't ask questions in the chat, we couldn't ask our colleagues in the chat, we had to call the team lead line. When we have meetings saying, \"we're starting to use NPS and we want to have really good scores\" but when the changes made and still being made are making things worse for the customer experience, when we process a work order that has to go to tier 2, but something in it wasn't done perfectly, and the customer calls back weeks later because their work order was never scheduled, and we see that tier 2 said something was missing and did nothing about it, didn't send an email, didn't assign it to the person who created it, literally notated that they can't do it because something was missing...how is that better for the customer? How is that going to get us better NPS scores than 0? When I have 0 power to do anything for a customer, where I can't promise anything, whether it can clearly be seen that they were over billed, or their system is on fire, I can't promise that we will compensate them or that a technician will actually show up for an appointment. When technicians show up to an appointment and don't even get out of their van before they leave and say they weren't able to do the work, all of these things happen often, and all of these things are completely unacceptable. What's also unacceptable is the Power Purchase Agreement; this is literally a scam for the customers. We put a system on their home that will produce more power than they use, and they get billed for all of it, plus a bill from their local utility company? How is this not a scam? On top of that, it goes up by almost 2% every year? That means that within 5 years, the per kWh charge they are billed at will be the same as or more than the utility companies kWh charge. I couldn't continue working for a company that claims they are saving customers money, claim to be a good thing for their customers, but is not that. The shady, underhanded nature of the business is a big part of why i couldn't maintain my employment at Vivint Solar.",

            "I was paid less than my counterparts reporting to the same manager but my performance was always above expectations. I was also paid anywhere from 10% to 20% less than my counterparts. At one point I asked for a raise and was told that my department did not grant raises unless it was during the annual review process. Two weeks later two people in the same organization received raises. I waited for the annual review process and did get a 25% raise but it was then at the 10% to 20% below my peers. \\\\The other problem I had with Vivint Solar was the way different departments were treated. Sales and Operations (Install) could spend money on all kinds of parties, trips, etc.. I took my team out for a lunch to a fast food restaurant for a birthday and was told it was excessive spending. For 6 of us the total cost was under $50. At the same time a Sales group took their whole team out to a steak dinner with alcohol and rented limo for the entire group with a plus 1. Then they rented out a night club after that spending over $9K and those expenses were approved.\\\\Also during the holidays the CFO sent out an email to all managers explaining instead of a corporate Holiday party we would have small department parties for less than $25 per person. Later we saw the executives went out for their Holiday party and took a plus 1 and spent hundreds per person. This is just one of many examples of how upper management does not practice what they preach.\\\\I don't understand why the Sales group is not held accountable for the decisions that they make. They spend in excess proven by their CPW going up over the past two years as the rest of the company CPW has gone down. But they still continue to be rewarded for their lack of performance and get to go on the Megawatt trip every year. Why not reward some of the higher performers at corporate with the Megawatt trip too? An example of their performance going down can be seen in the MW installed over Q2 and Q3 this year as we had our worst month in over 3 years in July. This is all when the sales force has increased this year exponentially. \\\\It also appeared that upper management would hire friends rather than those who were better qualified. This again can mostly be seen in the sales and install organization but the accounting organization brought in many friends and thus limited opportunities to those outside that group. I feel that accounting is finally getting to a point where there are some of those opportunities but know others don't feel the same about some other groups.\\\\We also did not get support from upper management on items outside the policy that they didn't follow or certain groups didn't follow see again the holiday parties or employees submitting expense reports that had items that were outside the company policy. \\\\There was no communication between upper management and my team. My boss had a director meeting with his boss weekly. Not once in my four years there was anything in that meeting discussed with me or my team. No updates on items, or things to improve or look for.",

Training should ALWAYS have base pay, not a lot of people that survive on their own can commit to potentially 1-2 months without pay. Once a salesman is up and running then switch them to just commission, but offer base (even minimum) hourly wages during training until the salesman's commission is check is higher than their hourly. Also, it is 2017... You expect salesman to buy their own ipad, which they HAVE to use during the sales AND you don't offer benefits... You will only have half-ass salesman that only know how to push people into a sale, rather than work with customers to make the best sale for them, when you offer NOTHING upfront. FYI Vivint, there are better products and markets for salesman to make more money without walking door-to-door on Saturdays. Make it more appealing to quality salesman with different types of sales people, more benefits, and more product offerings.",

Here what I did not like, A tremendous amount of Aageism, I got push back from Brian almost immediately coming aboard, non responsive to calls and text or would return calls text days later or not at all, made references to this is a young mans game, almost indignant to me making any money at all as a construction manager I offered to supply Brian with Roofing Subcontractos through the company I work for now and I was met with arrogance and yeah give me the information and I\u2019ll bet it out as if it was his decision for me to run to nickles together...

They were teaching us to basically lie to the customer to get in the door.  This is a real product.  With a real product you should never have to lie or deceive the customer,  lastly with Hispanic customers.  They would explain nothing to them just tell them to sign here it\u2019s going to alight it good just sign here was not cool at all.  The managers would garner all the heavy Hispanic territories around San Jose all to them selves because they new these were really easy to deceive.

            "Worked for Vivint Solar for close to 4 years and was an extremely successful District Survey Supervisor. I was a multiple recipient of top performer awards, elite operations winner, I trained multiple managers, created new innovative reporting structures and reporting sheets that were used to successfully improve my state and my regions KPIS and metrics monitoring. I was a part of the incentive build out program to generate new innovative goals and rewards to push department production. Received multiple recommendation letters from District Sales Managers, Operations managers, and Regional Operations Managers for a role to progress into a Regional Management role. I not once received a raise in my role as a District Manager, regardless of my performance. Personally felt that the department director was a poor leader that allowed pressure of senior management to be taken out on his teams. Since coming into the role we eliminated all previous incentive programs, due to lack of continuing to keep up with the metrics monitoring. Top performance metrics were never accurate 'The League'. Even after multiple District supervisors and Regional Managers investigated the discrepancies in the metrics nothing was ever changed. The director even became angry for looking into the reporting and numbers being pulled, \"because no one had asked me / us to do so.\" The district managers and surveyors were held to a completely un-obtainable metric standard that left the west coast at an impossible to overcome advantage. The same District Supervisor won the top performance award repeatedly even after the discrepancies were identified. He showed a complete disregard for field surveyors, by having performance metrics based of technician tiers that he had no idea how or where the tiers were created. A tier was supposed to be based on either time with company and pay or pay rate. However a Tech 1 that made $15 an hour in one state, where a tech in another state was making $23 and was labeled a Tech 1 in another.  Tier rates were supposed to hold techs accountable for production rates. Multiple techs were improperly labeled which prevented the techs from being able to receive compensation increases. Again, this WAS brought to his attention and nothing was done about it. This FORCED multiple team members to quit due to unfair compensation and unfair opportunity to advance. From the moment Andy Moore took over the Survey Department, team morale plummeted. There was no regard for team members in the field and his team of managers. The only thing that kept people around were the regional managers who were shunned if the brought anything up that was different from his way of thinking. It was a terrible feeling to have to leave a department that I had invested almost 4 years into, and helped grow with the original director Jason Anderson and then watch it get turned inside out by poor leadership. I was let go by because of a reduction in force due to a write up that was on my record that was over a year old and was told that it had been expunged. Though I was the most senior and highest performing District Managers in my department, I was let go because I had a write up that was over a year old. My replacement had been in his role (and trained by me) for less than 6 months... This was a complete abandonment by a company I dedicated myself too.Truly could not believe it. I hope that Vivint Solar finds a better way to appreciate and recognize those who are passionate about what they do and those who consistently go above and beyond. I hope that they take the time to realize how detrimental their current leadership has been towards not just their metrics, but the employees and their morale. When the company started, they cared about the individuals, and the company was employee centered. Andy ruined that mentality due to inability to lead and motivate his team, accept new ideas and welcome constructive criticism,  and improperly taking his frustration out on his team when his leadership put pressure on him.  Example: Evan wanted to know why surveyors weren't hitting their KPI's, but instead of Andy allowing his team to explain the logical reason or inaccuracy of the data, he refuted what they would say or refuse to hear explanation and would threaten disciplinary action..\\\\I truly hope that someone takes the time to read this and passes it to Evan or Paul. This is truly terrible what has and is happening in this organization. Techs and managers deserve better or it will continue to run down hill.",

What I am about to explain has nothing to do with Vivint Solar as a company but about operations management of NJ-06. \\\\My time with the company I loved. I moved up from installer to lead to foreman within 7months. Vivint Solar treats their employees pretty well. However, based on the OM I was fired for being late quite often. Being that everyone was also always late, I sense there was a deeper motive to why I was actually fired. I understood Vivint Solar\u2019s policies to tardiness, which doesn\u2019t change anything. However, I still showed up every day. There have been employees who have done \u201cno call no shows\u201d quite often. Yet not one of them have received any consequences. Favoritism was an obvious trate. When given the foreman position I never complained when I was given $24hr, when in fact we were told foreman\u2019s made nothing less than $27.50hr. I still didn\u2019t complain when the ground electrician on my crew was given a raise at $24hr. As a foreman I probably should have been upset that someone on my crew was making the same as me while I was doing a lot of the heavy lifting. But that would be unethical. \\\\Lack of understanding the teams concerns and needs was also careless and brushed off. Aggressive words, threats of laying off employers or deducting their hours, and profanity were often used when crews were unable to fully complete an install and/or when an entire crew felt unsafe. Write ups were falsified and stored to instill fear in employers. Which would then only get submitted when employees could not complete an install.\\\\ Many reason\u2019s to why an employee would want to leave a company. But in my case the company was great to me, the OM was not.",

            "If management would stop running the office like one big frat party! They discriminate against women and set you up for failure, it seems to only make their quota. I was locked in to an area by the local college where there were 90% of the current residents were students and retiree's well past their 60's, & on a fixed income. The managers start off extremely harsh by down grading women verbally in front of all the guys. I was even referred to as Donahue instead of Donna, then was told a laughing \"sorry.\" Then they spend company time doing guy things, like going to the local gun shooting range, without asking the women. This is all geared around deliver making you feel unwanted. People come on randomly late with lame excuses but it's ok depending on weather your male or female. Females get ridiculed on the spot and sent threatening email warnings of possible pending termination. Guys come in late and it's an oh that's ok. New hires men get treated with the upmost respect and offered all the onboarding details, I myself had to keep asking questions. I was talked down to like a 5 year old, so I stopped asking. I kept calling experienced co-workers to go out with them and got the run around. So I went out with the assistant manager only to be talked to worse than a dog, and scolded to never say a word when your shadowing. He later apologized. The clients wife asked me a simple question of what happens if someone dies...I mentioned no problem things would transfer over. I guess it was wrong and I needed to be harshly reprimanded. No one bothered to go over my pitch until weeks into it. Then my iPad was erased by the assistant manager, knowing that I didn't have the ability to upgrade the app. My app was continuously shut off in Doors, I kept calling the help line and The kept saying that I didn't have a home office. So as I door knocked it made it different to do my job. Newly hired guys had no issues with Doors. The final straw was when I was last to be told how to apply to get company shirts and apparel and was never told about the reimbursement that I was owed by passing my exam, whereupon I had to buy my own Home Improvement Book online simply because I was told by the lead manager repeatedly that I didn't need to worry about taking my test. I order the book after finding out that those hired after me, had their books the same week to study for. I was sent a group text  by both managers whom are best friends, how did I do on my state exam? They assumed o failed. I passed! I was hindered in every way then threatened that if o didn't have 5 sales by a certain date I would be fired! Needless to say i sent for my license at their office and the secretary said that she processed it and that it would take around 2 weeks or so. I kept calling the main office that handled that and they said they knew nothing. I called The Dept of Labor and they never received my application that I had signed by both the manager and assistant manager. I have them a few choice words after taking to another female that recently was let go for not making her quota. I found out through her that we had a deadline on making a certain amount of sales, something the head managers should have informed me about. New hired that were there were helped with their pitch one on one, I later complained and sent my own pitch via cell phone recording and was ridiculously ridiculed. I let another experiences solar sales guy listen and he said it wasn't so bad. These two managers in my opinion do not need to work in the same office. I now work for a different solar company and would highly recommend Vivint Solar because they run a top company. I just wouldn't recommend going to the Delmar Office if your a female. Total discrimination. I left these two managers with some harsh choice words of my own, including how they set me up for failure and that was out of character for me, and I felt they deserved it. They even asked those who came to check out the job offer, \"If you had an athelete that you would choose to have a man crush on, who would it be?\" Well, those two guys never came back after that awkward moment. Why would a head manager ask that? I hope this helps someone. I wasn't going to say anything, but if this testimony can help the next woman or man that's not into the whole frat like fiasco and antics on the job...then I have done my job. Once other male co-workers see how your being disrespected they to stay away from you, as if your poison, from all the negative back biting insults. There is too much favoritism as far as which areas consultants are assigned to, as far as the others, well expect to be locked into an area where they already know won't be productive. Again, I never got my license from them, after all the run around and head games. The End. Such a great company with poor money hungry managers, that want sales but set certain people up for failure. How do you fix something that they would never admit to. Don't take my word for it, check to see how many times I had contacted technical support, only to find out it was because I hadn't scheduled my exam in which the head boss said I didn't need to worry about??? Most of these guys failed their exam on the first try, I can say I still felt like a winner! No sales but the odds were against me from day one. Sad to witness. Sad to say. This is my truth. When other females excelled with the company, remarks were made like, \"oh they are successful only because they feel sorry for them and give them leads.\" It was not a good environment for me. It's a male dominated job but no one should be treated in such a demeaning way. No one. DP",

            "The direction they were going in the design department was away from human talent and toward automation and subdividing functions of design to different teams so that you can hire anyone to do those functions. There were essentially no standards except output of number of designs. The productivity requirements were ridiculous. The possibility of a raise kept getting moved further away. Upper management kept getting stricter about things that were completely unimportant and damaging to morale. To make it the kind of place to stay at long term you need to fire the head of the design department and change some basic cultural aspects of what you expect from the designers and provide a pathway of advancement that isn't based on moving them into management positions. The metrics you measured to gauge the value of your employees encouraged people to game your systems and drove quality lower. I abandoned the green energy field entirely because of working at Vivint Solar. Maybe you can't afford to treat your designers like skilled labor. Designer wages for green energy are pretty lousy in general so maybe you are normal for your field.",

I was never eligible for a raise despite meeting previous requirements, only to find extra \u201csecret requirements\u201d every time. The management wasn\u2019t very poor, immature, took every single thing you could imagine personally, would passive aggressively take it out on us in jobs, and was all around rude and inconsiderate. It seems to me that the only way to move up is to backstab and lie. Step on whoever\u2019s faces you can to get a leg up. It\u2019s unfair and inconsiderate not only to just your fellow man period, but especially your employers. I am deeply disappointed. On top of all that bullshit and lies, my parents who agreed to get panels on their house under my recommendation, have been paying more than their usual amount for their power bill. I am fairly certain this is an elaborate scam to be quite frank. I honestly have even more to say but not the time or energy to do so. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak out.

            "Better training from the start. I received no orientation. Both my manager, Bob Berry, and Supervisor Doug, Did not take the time to instruct me on procedures of day to day operations. The use of an accounting program to run inventory for a warehouse is a disaster waiting to happen. Inventory was not fully being tracked correctly. Some parts were not in the system at all. While others were in , but, without monetary values. Part numbers were incorrect on pick sheets and nothing was done to correct  them. And, I was forced to work 12 to 14 hours a day, six days a week. I left when i was told I had to work the holiday without any compensation. The Installers were receiving extra compensation for working the holiday. \\The manager and supervisor were very unorganized and unprofessional.",

It is my understanding that you automatically terminate sales people when there has been no sales activity for 30 to 60 days. It has also come to my attention that a sales person who has been put on the inactive list can call the main office and request being reinstated so as to be able to complete a sale. I am still employed with Vivint and intend to continue speaking to potential clients who are interested in solar.

            "There were several weeks that management announced late in the week that 8-10 hours of overtime would be required that week, forcing us to cancel plans and work through the weekend. I was fine with working overtime, and even occasional mandatory overtime, but the way it was handled by upper management was disrespectful of the time and lives of their employees. Give adequate notice about changes in schedule and required overtime. Actually listen to feedback from employees, rather than just pushing through things from the top down with no communication between upper management and designers.\\\\Also, follow through with promises about pay raises based on performance. From my own experience and the experience of friends working at Vivint Solar, the pay raises were rare and tiny, and the scheme by which raises could occur was changed several times and was never very clear. \\\\Otherwise, I had a great time working at Vivint Solar.

            "For one, I was never able to get my doors application location fixed. For the longest time, I was scheduled in Visalia instead of Santa Maria. My manager and I both emailed multiple individuals to try and get this fixed and it never was. However, there was no hesitation to take away any of my Vivint application capabilities. In addition, I was told there was going to be a Santa Maria office when I began, which was also false. I was going to have to commute to Camarillo more than twice a week for meetings. Which is quite ridiculous considering there is technology like Zoom, RingCentral and gotomeeting. In all honesty, I would have stuck with Vivint had my Doors application location been working. However, I shadowed another employee who didn't have his set up and witnessed the struggles first hand. I would not work without the proper tools for success and going forward I would advise you to not allow new employees to be shorthanded with their Doors application. It is key for CRM capabilities and CRM is paramount when it comes to any sales environment.",

Like implementing surveys to customers without regard as to how they are going to be answered and who is going to take care of complaints. \\Another example is how Vivint pushes for numbers and systems to be pushed out and yet the quality with those numbers is deeply diminished. The most important change that really needs to be made is some of the leadership. There implementation of processes probably costs Vivint more than intended but the lack of accountability for those mishaps in change is what is troubling. I can appreciate what Vivint has taught me. It has been a great to learn of what not to do.  I have been able to use that experience and knowledge in my current job, as a what not to do for management.",

Stop treating the sales reps like unaccountable representatives. A great deal of them try to get out of what they promise customers and for the most part they do get away with it. I had one such incident where a representative made a promise that he did not want to keep and then an operations higher up tried to get the company (Vivint) to pay for it. That operations higher up lied and said that the the rep didn't work for Vivint anymore. I looked up the rep and he was a regional manager and still employed.   I informed the correct people about who the funds should be applied too. If that happened I don't know, but until Vivint looks at how things are really working, then important changes at the top would have to be made, but until then Vivint will work as it has, with gaping holes of revenue or other trying to cover it up.",

            "Well for starters, maybe if the upper management (the people making the decisions) knew, or cared, how their decisions affect the real people at the bottom *doing all of the work.*\\\\After nearly a year and a half of working at VSLR it became very clear to me that all they see is $ dollar signs $ and not people.  They make changes in our process that benefit the company, but ignore the very real negative affect it has on THE PEOPLE who are actually doing the work that makes them money.  Remember, without designers, you get no designs, and thus make no money.  So treat your employees with respect, right?  Seems obvious to me, but apparently not to them.\\\\I say that because from literally day 1 they started arbitrarily raising requirements.  First they bumped the minimum production to 3 points.  Sure, that's achievable, so whatever, I kept going.  Then they raised it to 3.5 points, which is, depending on how lucky you are with the accounts you pull, arguably much more difficult to achieve for your average designer.  And forget about achieving tier 2 or above.  Especially because if you make mistakes on designs EVER, that essentially bars you from getting a raise (95% accuracy required or no raise at all).\\\\It just seems to me that the management was doing everything in their power to stop designers from getting raises, to block us from advancing in the company.  That's not a healthy business practice.  Because people know their worth, and they know that they deserve better treatment than that.  So if your company continues to treat their designers poorly, if they continue to pile more and more work on to the design team without EVER compensating them with more pay, people WILL quit and find different jobs.\\\\Sure, you can hire more people.  But if you think you can turn n burn through new employees like Vivint inc. does, you'll be sorely disappointed.  It takes a good 4-6 MONTHS for a new designer to be able to produce the MINIMUM stats required by management.  If you really think that forcing all of your good designers out and replacing them with new people will accomplish anything, you're wrong.  Especially because the training was basically non-existent.  How do you expect new people to accomplish anything without training?\\\\So, in short, this company's business practice is purely illogical and greed based.  You may be able to stay afloat for a while by exploiting your employees, but it will only take you so far before people grow weary of being mistreated and leave.  Then what?",

            "Well for starters they respect me, they appreciate the hard work that I do, and they don't constantly throw more work at me without compensating me with more pay.  More work = more pay.  That's how it works in the real world.  You don't get to just force people to keep taking on more responsibility without giving them more in return.",

But seriously, Design is the work horse of the company and it seems like they just get punished every time any thing goes wrong, even if it's not their fault.  Like for example, the company issued a sales incentive for the sales reps, to get them to sell more.  As a result, we had extremely large back logs that kept growing no matter how much we chipped away at it.  And because of this, you started issuing MANDATORY OVERTIME for your DESIGNERS.  You PUNISHED us purely because of your sales incentive, not because of anything that we did wrong.  There are other examples of this practice that happened during my time there.  You need to quit doing that otherwise you won't have any designers before long.",

I have a new job where we hire to keep individuals for their careers, we have a stable working environment, a staff that trusts each other and amazing benefits.  VSLR needs to focus on creating a stable work environment for employees. Provide training on how the entire process works from sale to install.  Have upper management that can gain the trust of the employees they work with.  Show respect for all employees and a sincere interests in all employees.  Create an environment where it feels like a small company even though it is a large one.  Be consistent in policies. There are a lot of improvements that could really improve the work environment to retain employees.   My current firm most have been here for 10-30 years because they are respected, given opportunities for growth, amazing benefits, and most importantly good people to work with.",

Upper management needs to learn how to manage stress and work load.  Employees need to feel safe when reporting harassment and issues with their superiors.  Instead of all the nice fancy events, jazz games, big employee engagement events focus on making substantial changes.

I have bills to pay so this lack of communication kept me from confidently resigning from my previous employment and going to any training. When communication was established I still received little detail on what was to happen next and with the previous experience my trust was dissolved. But the biggest thing that kept me from staying with the company was the lack of predictability to the schedule. That is the true problem. I would have kept going far more if there was some predictability to it. Even if it was minimum wage on predictable, with commission based pay. it would have been perfect. If you wish to recruit people with consistency. Reliable pay schedules and merit based bonuses will work great.",

As a recent college grad with a dire in accounting, I walked into Vivint thinking I could learn all I needed to know to make sales within a few weeks. However I found myself pouring hours of research into this role and still not making sales, which ultimately meant that I could not get paid. I received 2 training pays in 2 months, and my accounts kept dropping despite being out knocking doors at least 3 days a week, so it was looking bleak that I would get a third. The one account I did a welcome call for wound up not going through with the project because corporate bounced back our contract that was $.80 off and he wouldn\u2019t sign it again.

            "Better training(3 different trainers in 3 weeks),  that allows you to learn the job correctly, and not saying \"just get the job done for now and we'll finish training later.\" I was told by one trainer (Joseph Goga) that working 16 hour days while trying to learn policy and procedure is just \"the vivint challenge.\" I was left on my own to figure lots of things out. I also felt it was unnecessary to have me working 15 to 16 hour days for weeks at a time ( especially during training). I don't see how someone could do their job correctly running off of 4 hours of sleep a night. Also there is a huge lack of communication between warehouse and the operations manager (Matt Jackson). He would add jobs to the installers in the middle of the day without communicating to the warehouse and i would just have to \"deal with it\" when the crews came back which wuld keep me at the warehouse till almost 11 at night. Also, I felt like a bus boy having to clean the installers trucks for them. And for the record, it's highly unsanitary and utterly disgusting to have bottles with urine in them on the trucks for me to clean. I feel like the warehouse specialist does the brunt of the work while the lead gets to work less and gets paid more. Seems a little backwards. Not a healthy work environment. Good Luck Vivint!",

At 47 years old I\u2019ve done this type of work for decades before some of these reps were born. Lol. I\u2019ve even been a District Manager for a Fortune 500 insurance company. You guys have a great system for Pay and other rewards for those who work hard. The disconnect is when your reps run into a legit buyer who\u2019s interested and the deal falls apart when they fumble through NEO because there is no mechanism like a \u201ctraining mode\u201d option. Even if it wasn\u2019t a traditional classroom style learning scenario, if your software guys could just ad a \u201ctraining mode\u201d tab where reps could practice at home etc that would be a huge huge positive step.",

            "The biggest thing is getting the new reps trained on NEO and other apps to a certain proficiency level before turning them loose to sell and subjecting them to accountability for production. This causes huge stress and anxiety especially for the young guys. Second, I\u2019d say the management positions, what\u2019s expected of them, needs to be totally overhauled. If a working DM spends 2 hrs a week doing hands on training they are never going to win any of the sales contests and would probably lose 1-2 deals per month just for lack of available hours in their day. That equates to probably a $3k-$5k loss every month and that\u2019s just on the front end, not counting the detriment to their overall numbers for quarterly bonus incentives. Third, all these reps are 1099 employees and Vivint has probably one of the cheapest employee overhead costs of any company in the direct sales industry. So the question is, who cares if a rep sells 2 deals a month or 10? People in general are already self motivated by a larger paycheck to attempt to get as many deals as they can and for some people it takes longer than others to get up to speed. But if that person is not a problem employee and is working on increasing production why keep threatening to fire them if they don\u2019t produce more? If I hadn\u2019t quit I would have been fired for underproduction. In fact I was booted out of NEO and my email was closed before anyone told me the door was closing for me at Vivint. And to this day I have never been officially notified of anything relating to the circumstances of my departure with the exception of this post employment survey today. I wish I was still working for Vivint but I was pushed out by my DM, corporate or both I have no idea. In summary Pay and opportunity are great. Site management procedures need a total revamp. Training on Vivint specific software and apps is horrible to non existent.",

When Vivint gets smart and does what SunRun did by allowing dealers to sell their offering, contact me and maybe we can reconnect.  Vivint has the best PPA in the business, but their loan product is extremely sub-par, and home owners are going to be extremely upset once they find out that there is a 25% spread their sales people can sell your product at.  Also, you need to do in house cleaning of management.  Many leaders I dealt with at Vivint will outright lie to customers and their sales people.  They are terrible examples.  It's a shame they sell so well, but when people trust you and you lie to get a deal done, it's a shame.",

Lack of communication by management was the biggest issue. After my first week I had to ask, well what do I do now. No one told me I had to purchase an Ipad or download doors on it etc, I was literally lost and I was ready to work and knock on doors. Other than poor training I would say I had a positive experience and the culture at Vivint Solar was great. Any follow up questions email me at Russ1717@gmail.com thanks.",

            "I was a very good employee and would have been a supervisor if I had stayed. I decided to go back to school at the University of Utah to finish my Electrical engineering degree. I asked to lower my hours I needed to work in order to be successful in school which they were willing to do since I was an exceptional employee. I was very transparent with my plans with management and was hoping to use my degree to help Vivint solar be more stable and organized as the electrical engineering department always seemed swamped and the current electrical engineer is not happy with the work load to the point he has wanted to quit several times. I asked to only drop my hours during the semester and would be more than happy to work full time when I wasn't in school \\\\Although I gave my all to Vivint Solar and stayed over night and worked voluntary overtime to help my team succeed and the company meet their goals. Management decided to tell me that I needed to produce full time numbers while working part time or they would have to let me go, they gave me less than a half weeks warning for this. I did not appreciate the short notice as I have always been respectful and given more than 2 weeks notice of my plans with the company, I believe 2 weeks should have been given as that is what you expect from your employees. \\\\The pay was ok but should have been higher as Vivint Solar is the lowest in the industry. What was more frustrating was being promised a raise and then never seeing it come to fruition. I was around during the sun edison \"merger\" and we were promised if we did so much work and gained so much experience  we would be \"CAD Tech 2\" and get a raise. Obviously the Merger fell through and the raises never happened which is fine the thing that bugged me the most is no one ever explained what happened or that we weren't getting raises they simply never talked about it which is terrible management and leadership in my opinion. And honestly that is one example of hundreds of examples of poor management and leadership.\\\\ I think many of the persons in management are very under-qualified for their position an were hired solely based on friendships with managers, which is sad but true. One example of this is when John Hard hired Cameron Snyder. This was a disaster he had no idea what he was doing and I heard he said he wanted to fire someone who didn't come in to work a mandatory shift to create an example of them. Great managers lead by example and find the tools necessary to make their employees and company succeed, I believe Cameron was on a power trip with poor management skills and did not have the technical skills necessary to understand the business. Don't get me wrong I like Cameron as a person and was actually his 2nd pick to become a supervisor, I merely bring this up to show that he wasn't a good fit and was chosen by John Hard because he was friends with him at Dish Network. Two other current supervisors where promoted at the same time one would sleep under his desk during work a week after I caught this individual doing this he was promoted. Another person that was promoted I would say was at his desk 30% of the time it got so bad that people from his team would come ask me design questions and I would answer probably 80% of their phone calls because he wasn't at his desk working. \\\\John Hard I think did a good job with the business and analytical part of the business but I can tell you that 95% of the employees did not respect or like him and had no confidence in his leadership. He is a very abrasive individual and constantly was offending the employees and management. My supervisor interviewed an individual that was related to John Hard and said she recommended them not to be hired and John Hard went and spoke with HR and convinced them to hire this individual which would appear to be the definition of nepotism. I would have reported this to HR but I did not witness it first hand and only heard it from my manager. \\\\A lot of this sounds very negative and that isn't my intent, I only bring up these points so that you may improve the culture of Vivint Solar. I really enjoyed working for Vivint Solar and gained a lot of experience and knowledge. It was an awesome job with interesting and challenging work. I would say the pros outweigh the cons and I would work at Vivint Solar again if I could make enough money to support my family working.  I would have never left, but I had to do what was best for myself and Family. \\\\Thank you for the opportunity to give my opinion, \\\\Shaun Oaks",

I feel the whole sales structure for the solar energy industry needs to be severely changed because it is pushing people away and it seems like the only people that qualified for solar were already well off people meaning not helping the people that really need the savings pay less for power. The place I worked at seemed set up sort of like a pyramid scheme where the managers got bonuses for the sales reps work as well. If this industry changes I would love to be in it but as it is now I do not see that happening as I have taken my talent elsewhere.",

            "For a sales organization, there is a disconnect in the fundamentals that encourage productivity and growth.  The unofficial company motto is \"Lead from the front\", which provides for strong completion, but should not be used as a basis for determining leaders.  It was evident in the stat sent to us all before a manager retreat that noted 50% of the installs 3rd quarter came from 15% of the sales staff.  That sales staff being the District Managers.  Sounds great, but that means 85% of your sales group is producing at a far great rate.  Vivint promotes and extends the pay of managers, who while leading the office in installs, have no time to mentor the core.  21 and above installs in a quarter requires a tremendous amount of personal work.  The reality is Vivint offices have DM's that sell and sales reps that suffer.  Turnover is high and the common feeling for those leaving is that Vivint didn't care.   I came into this position with 17 years of home improvement sale, with the last 4 years in solar sales management.  A manager should manage, not teach a door pitch and expect the reps to wing it from there.  Solar as simple as it seams is complex.  I can only speak for the NorCal district, but there is no current sales training process that expands to solar 101, sales psychology, time management, Vivint policy and procedure, even appearance and attire.  For 6 months I watched week after week, manager after manager dedicate their time to a door knocking pitch.  They have this dialed in and are successful in their approach, but know little about solar as a whole.  Only a few robots make a living this way.  Most place in a sink or swim environment succom to the stress and financial famine.  By the time I earned the trust of my office staff they were eager to learn and valued the time spent expanding their knowledge.  I even provided additional meeting days where I was available for team members to join me on a voluntary basis.  The reality is... a 5% override to actually manage, while the other two managers split the remaining 95% makes no sense for me.   \\\\There are many operations issues within Vivint as well.  Too much to detail, but the opportunity for improvement is huge.  The framework is there.   The man power is there.   The business strategy and decision making is lacking.  Hope this helps in some way.  Thank you again for the opportunity.",

Didn't want to leave the group but I had a serious problem with Knocking on doors.  I thought I could overcome the feeling but I just couldn't.  I have been in professional sales for over 25 years and overcame many challenges and was able to handle rejections and disappointment easily but in my own home I tremendously dislike people soliciting door to door to me.  I just couldn't ignore that feeling when I knocked on other doors.  If there was an alternate form of marketing that was available to new hires from the beginning with maybe an initial guaranteed compensation plan for getting started I think I could have been very successful for myself and for Vivint.",

I\u2019ve been in sales for thirty years and no one company applied the pressure to perform, compete and race like Vivint.  The pressure that was applied to my DM\u2019s was passed through to the team.  I watched as good door to door people had to bow out because they only wanted to work for three or four days a week, when in fact we were being guilted into long hours, knocking on doors after dark.  Ridiculous.  You need to utilize the people you have to do what they can do and not what you think they should do or who they should be racing to be recognized.  What you\u2019re doing is a high turnover game for people in their early twenties.  I\u2019d rather sell cars (and I\u2019m too good of a salesperson for that).",

            "Hello Ms. Amber Martindale\\\\    I don't think you knew my situation when you hired me, or it didn't mean much to you at the that time. But I was a homeless, Veteran living partly in my car and partly with the support of several friends, while waiting for my reservation to open in a newly constructed apartment building, here in Long Beach.  I told this to the DM's at the ELA office, several times, whom by the way didn't seem to care or extent any sense of welcome to me. I also reached out to you twice and got no reply which made me feel that I was not valued either.  \\\\   The completion date of my apartment complex, was originally August 2017, then September then October and by that time I thought that Vivian managers were tired of hearing next month, next month.... I was, so I stopped reporting the reoccurring delays,thinking I was a W-9, and on commission, I would just start working after I moved in.  Finally in late November I moved in and was anticipating to start working after getting organized....when to my surprise I received an email. asking why I quit. Which I had not.... but I will assume I was let go do to inactivity. (even thou you were made aware of my circumstance and struggle). \\\\   I went to great troubles to obtain an Ipad, attend sales meetings, access and complete the training etc...with my limited budget. You should try functioning without a place to, shower, launder, sleep or eat, maybe you could then appreciate how much effort I put forth, to come and work for you at my expense. \\\\  As a result of this experience, I wonder... if kids that think they know something (but don't really) can sell solar with just effort an a script, what might I do with my 4 degrees, General Contractors licence, R.E. Brokers License, HIS registration, and 100's hours of solar system installation with Grid Alternative, an shortly my NABCEP certification ?   What do you think I am capable of with this type of determination, and effort.  We'll see, but unfortunately, not with your company, not the way I was treated.  \\\\  So, for your exist survey, 1.) Treat everyone with respect particularly those who are dynamic, even thou you don't know who that might be. 2.) This won't change but can be modified....you take advantage of the ignorance of youth, this is as old as the hills, toss them some scrapes off the table and they'll think their Gods. (have someone with experience and knowledge run your office, kids leading kids is cheap but you might be more effective with professional supervision.\\\\     I apologize for my attempt to re-enter the work force before I was established and ready to work. My net worth in the 1990's through 2007 was over 37 million, I have made it and lost it 3 times. I was so embarrassed, ashamed, and depressed since then until the end of last year, at which time I snapped out it, reconciled my angry and dismay and decide to make another attempt at prosperity.  God has reasons for providing us with these experiences, and this I thank you.... for showing me how things in today's business world have changed.  \\\\\\Sincerely, \\\\Anthony Taranto",

            "I was employed at Vivint two separate times and the second time I came back I was really bought in but after a month I realized my DM was out for himself, I couldn't reach him and he would never answer a question and when I did ask questions in person I was given answers that sounded good but we're not true. I worked with two newer sales reps and helped them both because I had prior experience at Vivint. I think a lot of the reps who leave Vivint are capable of being very successful but when they do not get support they leave. I was in the LI west office and sometimes we shared the meetings with the Nassau office and the two DM's (Tony and Chase) seemed to genuinely care about there reps but it was not like that in the office I was in, I have witnessed a lot of wrongdoing at Vivint including illegal behavior and I never understood why corporate never steps in to find out why. I always thought watching Chance Allred on VSLR tv and also meeting him in person that he was one of the most honest straight forward people I've ever met but and all of the support people I have worked with from Utah seemed to be an extension of Chance but at the LI west office it's a different story, I have met a lot of good people and made many friends during my time at Vivint and I still run into a lot of former employees and everyone has something negative to say but when you listen to the issues its not directed at Vivint corporate it's a few of the people who were deceptive, dishonest and most of all greedy. I know my opinion especially as a former employee does not matter but the reason I am passionate about all of this is because a lot of good things came from my time there and I was proud to be Vivint and I just do not understand why corporate never stepped in to find out and maybe even make some changes. I'm not bitter, the truth is I actually have given three referrals to an active rep and one was installed last week. I realize a good amount of what I wrote is not positive so I will end this with something positive that I really feel strongly about, the operations dept. in Westbury is ran by two people, Mike Mortenson and Georgi Dhima and they are what separates Vivint from the other Solar companies on Long Island and I have had a lot of experiences with them were they resolved issues and taught me a lot as well, Vivint really has two gems including the teams they run. Please feel free to contact me, but if I do not hear from you I want to wish you a happy holiday to everyone at corporate, a lot of which I've spoken to on the phone but have never met but really enjoyed working with.",

I messaged my DM leader multiple time throughout the month and I later stopped receiving responses. I tried logging into the system to present a CAD one day and I found out I didn\u2019t have access anymore. I was upset and messaged the DM again but still no response. I was removed from all group chats and received no messages from DMs telling me they decided to let me go. Terrible experience with this employer. But I\u2019m honestly better off. Try to teach honestly and ethics to the DMs next time. No wonder I see so many negative comments on Vivint\u2019s Facebook.",

            "The main issue I had was with being blocked from making the type and magnitude of impact I was hired to make (or what is typically expected of people in my profession).  I had good backing from my direct management in what I was doing, but I could not getting a foothold to make an impact in a couple major departments where most of the spend is coming from.  When roadblocks popped up there wasn't anyone there to help me clear the path.  With me being a Sr. Manager there is only so much I could do to influence Directors, VPs, and C-level execs.  Many times I felt that VSLR wanted more of a finance person who does purchasing on the side.  \\\\Compensation almost always plays a factor in deciding to leave a job or company.  VSLR is in a tough situation with finances being tight and I can understand some of the reasons why they may not compensate as well as other companies and why they may not pay bonuses or give raises.  There are disparities in compensation based on who you work for, who you are, etc.  In my experience and the experience of others I've spoken with on this subject, VSLR pays well below market compensation.  Once you are hired on at a certain rate you can't see more than a 10% increase for the most part.  A 2.5% or lower increase was more typical if a raise was given at all.  The only time I was able to get more than a 10% raise was when I had another job offer. Finances are tough and margins are thin in this industry, but it all just makes you feel a lot like a number to be managed down and less like a valuable employee who is fairly compensated for the position and the value you bring to the company.",

Outside of compensation and roadblocks that couldn't be overcome it was difficult to find another company that I felt comfortable moving to considering all of the benefits and job satisfaction I had with VSLR.  I worked for Vivint Smart Home and Vivint Solar for 11.5 years and I loved it.  It was difficult for me to leave, but it was the best decision at the time.  I might not have left if I was compensated a bit better and empowered more to do the job that I could have done without the roadblocks.",

I did not see a way to make more or grow with the 10% cap. I was also not given freedom to make choices and voice my opinions on projects. All there is a ton of sexism going around and males throwing around degrading jokes to women. Our HR department was a joke and I never felt comfortable or was not able to trust that they would help. Mostly the morale is so low and everyone, except executive leadership, is paid poorly. If you want people to stick around, pay them more. Instead you hire people from outside the company, with no loyalty, and pay them more. Doesn\u2019t make sense. So should I quit and try to get rehired a few months later so I can get paid properly??",

A huge part of the pitch, includes leaving a packet of info, for the customer. Managers said to improvise. That might work for experienced salesmen, but for a day 1 grunt, it made the difference on quite a few occurrences between in the house or walking on. Managers have to make sales as well, so you're on your own. Most of the apps crashed or locked and no one could answer what my login info was for the tiled app anyway. Having onsite admin or support would definitely help set new hires up for success. \\\\Besides that, driving hundreds of miles in southern California traffic, for all the 'trainings' and group pow wows, while not even making minimum wage ended up with me spending more money than I made in the month and a half I worked there. I knocked over 500 doors made 6 accounts and they all canceled. \\\\I applied to the 'Field Solar Energy Consultant' job posting, thinking it was an site analysis position, I have experience with array design and install. I've never been a salesman, but heard about the earning potential and gave it my all, everyday I went out. I have found I am not a salesman.

With the help of my manager, I tried for over 2 months to get answers and get the process completed. I was still in limbo with Vivint when another opportunity came along that I could take advantage of immediately so I went that direction. If Vinvint's process had worked or been easier to troubleshoot for what went wrong I would probably be working there today. Since there were quite a few of us who came over from SolarCity all at the same time, it might have been helpful if Vivint had identified a specific go to resource who understood what that transition was about so that any issues could be easily dealt with by one person instead of many who never seemed to know what anyone else was doing or had already done.",

            "I gave a notice of resignation but 2 days before my resignation date, I was told that there had been a theft the night I worked and I was blamed for leaving a vehicle unlocked and it was inferred that I was suspected of theft. I had not stolen anything and I locked the van the way I did every night. I was dismissed before my resignation date and paid for the remaining two days. I worked hard as a Vivint employee and I did not steal from Vivint and I took offense to the way I was treated when I tried to leave the company respectfully. There was too much time spent trying to cast blame for mistakes and discrepancies in inventory while too little time was spent on improving the company and supply chain processes. I have worked for renowned logistics and supply chain companies and I found that upper management in Vivint seemed to have little understanding of how to make the company logistically and financially efficient when concerning the warehouse and installation processes. Management was too focused on spending hours fixing minor inventory discrepancies instead of using that time effectively on more pressing issues. I know accuracy is important but there was a lack of understanding of what priorities came first. Poor management decisions cost me valuable work hours and in turn cost the company money.",

I was \"moved\" from a commission only sales rep position to the retail team doing lead generation and promised a weekly minimum bonus of $450 plus $150/lead. They told me in order to accept I had to commit 30 hours a week and encouraged me to quit my other job (where I made over $20/hr) and start monday. When I requested an updated contract they told me they were \"waiting on paperwork\" but assured me the program was already up and running and I would be paid.  So I worked 30 hrs a week plus 3 hours of commuting through LA traffic everyday for the entire month of December. I never received an updated contract and I was never paid ANYTHING.  When I contacted HR they told me there was never a promise of the weekly minimum (even though there was) and claimed that none of the 25+ leads I generated were payable. I lost my home and was forced to move back in with family after not making any money all month. I had a great job and Vivint said I would make twice as much then just wrecked my life and acted like nothing happened. I will be pursuing legal action if this is not remedied ASAP.",

There were many instances where clients would call into Vivint solar ustomer service and were not getting the help they needed and then calling me out of dissatisfaction with there issues that have still not been resolved. Vivint corporate didn\u2019t provide solutions or listen to our office attempts to figure out processes for general inefficiencies that plagued the sales process  such as: help with NOC\u2019s, reroofing, permitting and overall scheduling job installs  / progression of jobs. \\\\Overall there seems to be a disconnect and mismanagement at a higher level where the office and many reps wouldn\u2019t have the company support which lead to a toxic and stressful work environment.",

            "It\u2019s unfortunate because solar is an amazing product to sell, even the Vivint offering was good, technical tools (iPad tools), amazing culture and community office. But the issues and problems have been overlooked and mismanaged by Vivint Solar Corp. I felt sick at times hearing some of the customers complaints about not getting help from talking to Vivint solar Corp. Operations and  processes have severely limited our ability to get permits submitted and jobs installed and make a steady income. Not having more team support (assistants to help manage progression of accounts) ultimately has made working for Vivint unenjoyable, toxic and very stressful. A clear example of this was whe we were part of this pilot program by Chrissy & Ahslei (they managed multiple DMs accounts for years) where they came in and helped managed our (teams) accounts progression to install after we sold a job. Overall job satisfaction increased, team productivity went up, more jobs went through and the timing of job sold to install was considerably faster. Unfortunately, Vivint Corp did not support that pilot program and things went back to how they were before. Shortly after many reps left, all those issues and ineffiences that existed prior came back and overall production went down. The pilot program showed clear evidence and results and promising new processes that solved all the ineffiencies we had as sales reps and as an office. It seemed that Vivint Corp was not willing to bankroll hiring team operational support and as a result the work environment went back to how things were. After realizing things weren\u2019t going to change and the issues were met with apathy from Vivint HQ I realized it\u2019s better to jump ship then try to polish the brass on the titanic. I don\u2019t feel that people in Vivint HQ realize how diffiicult knocking doors and selling 20-50k contracts for solar really is in a loan markets  I feel there is a clear disconnect between upper management and the \u201cfoot soldiers.\u201d It\u2019s unfortunate as I had a lot of good memories and experiences with team.",

Vivint would have been so much more successful and in such a better place today if it launched with a professional, mature culture.  The great pay would have attracted quality, high caliber people.  The punk, bro culture is an albatross around the neck of VSLR that is far to late to change now.\\4. Vivint Solar is a roof deification company.

            "Management is terrible at Vivint Solar. Training is seen by lower management as a hindrance to productivity. Internal communication is severely neglected. Designers are severely overworked. Upper management ignores the talent of lower employees that can help improve the company. This viewpoint is shared by managers in the engineering department. As a personal example, I've had three years of experience in quality in a heavily regulated industry, have taken classes on quality systems, and am a certified quality technician through the American Society of Quality. As a result, I was in a unique position to improve the company by incorporating an ISO-based quality system, but my suggestions were largely ignored, and those that were looked at were executed poorly or not understood. Being a quality technician and reviewing accounts and OA redesigns, I was able to see the response pattern to some issues, and the complete lack of it for others. Vivint Solar will never seriously improve their quality until upper management gets rid of their culture which only looks at talent and ideas from either upper management, those who rub elbows with them, or those who fit their idea of what management should look like. Engineers are notorious for pointing out flaws, especially quality engineers, which I've noticed is at odds with the salesperson culture of upper management. The biggest change that would have made me stay would be the change of the culture of upper management.",

Perhaps if Vivint offered more support and training for people new with door to door sales, I could have hit the ground running, rather than feeling as though I was struggling to keep my head above water. I feel I was starting to get into he swing of things just as another opportunity presented itself for another gig which I could not pass up.

I was disappointed by this because I saw my coworkers struggling with calls they did not feel adequately trained for, and their efforts to receive more training were largely met with frustration from their leadership. I did not sign up for a customer service position, I signed up for a scheduling position, so I decided not to move forward. I also was frustrated when I spoke with my supervisor about reducing my hours (I was in a full-time position) and he said that unless I was going back to school or had a compelling reason I needed to do so, I would not be approved to do so. If I could have reduced my hours and stayed, and the position was still scheduling installations, I would have stayed. I really enjoyed the work environment and found my coworkers to be exceptionally friendly. I also really appreciated the opportunity to have easy access to free healthy meals each day. I think this company is great, but for several reasons, this job in particular was not a good fit for me.",

It took  60 days before I could finally get anyone to take any action and then it took forever to get the ball rolling trying to get things turned around.   I could not in good conscious go out and sell anymore VIVINT  systems knowing that they were not monitoring the systems or taking a proactive stance to fix them when they do go down.

            "The thing is, there aren't just one or two issues that would help employees want to stay. Very few of the management personel (whether lower, middle, or upper) seem to really care about their subordinates. Commands and mandates are thrown down with little to no real communication on what the goal is, or (more often) how to achieve it. The upper management lies and uses deceptive wording to keep the masses under control and willing to work. When a plan is laid out and prepared for, the 'leadership' changes the whole plan at the last minute, and expects everyone to just figure out how to make it work. There are promises of raises and promotions thrown out all the time, but there's almost always some feeble excuse to not follow through with them. Instead, workers just get more and more duties with no extra compensation. The workers take on the extra work, with the hope of getting recognized for their extra work and given promotions or raises. But since the workers are taking it without complaint, the leadership sees no reason to give out extra compensation. Why pay more when you don't have to? So the extra work becomes the expected normal workload, and the whole cycle starts over again. Lower level employees are not valued in the slightest bit. There is next to no attempt made toward employee retention. There are plenty of other college-age kids here, who are desperate for a job, right? When upper leadership refers to their employees as \"the equivalent of burger flippers\", there's clearly a problem. None of the executives seem to care, and those who might don't know because the ones causing the majority of the problems (Evan Pack) are making it look like everything is just hunky dory.\\Bottom line: in order to significantly increase employee retention beyond a year, major changes in pay, communication, processes/policies and overall leadership have to occur. But I'm more than confident that none of those necessary changes will happen. Vivint Solar is a sinking ship, with its sails aflame.",

            "Mark Paulson was my manager for Roseville California. I thought it was going to be a great opportunity my first week I signed a sign on bonus $750 per week if I hit each week goal, Week 1 finish training got a proposal was on a roll. Unfortunately technology failed and my user was reset I'm not sure why and I was unaware. Because of this malfunction Mark had to enter my proposal under his name he dropped the ball I was not paid for my first week like I was told I was going to be and then he told me to just have the homeowners who I got a proposal for just sign and cancel so I could get my second weeks bonus unfortunately I was uncomfortable doing that because that's not how I do business noun I was supposed to be paid that Friday for the previous week's goal of getting a proposal and finishing training I was never paid he told me I'd be getting paid the following Wednesday at this point I was very uncomfortable and not having good feelings about the company so I told him I don't think it's going to work out and he told me well I'm sorry then you're not going to get paid. I do not want anything to do with Mark Poulsen Vivint lied to and used so I packed all of the work equipment into the FedEx box and sent it back to corporate you continue to harass me and tell me how I was stealing items from the company which I was not I had an absolutely awful experience with Vivint solar and it set me back big time. I never did receive the $750 that I was told I was going to receive if I could rate my experience with Vivint solar it would be a -5 it was a waste of my time and energy I was frauded lied to and corporate had nothing to say except email somebody about it that must mean you have a lot of problems like this if I can't speak to a person or a representative of Vivint solar to fix what I went through I'm not going to waste anymore time and move on",
            "24",
            "Real training I actually know how solar works how to calculate to find system sizing. And how to sell solar. Every question that I had to Mark Poulsen his answer was it doesn't matter it's super simple 17 cents per it just makes sense there's no reason to go with anybody else there's no reason to invest in solar but yeah I had no idea how solar work I feel that it was a complete scam",

            "Initial direction. Spent 1st few weeks hitting up doors selling PPA in an area where we don't do PPA. Very little guidance on area. The office was undergoing a transition and there was only 1 leader who was very good but did not have the bandwidth to help everyone. By the time a new leader had arrived to help him I already found an opportunity. Also in early stages different leaders would come in & offer their experience but was very fragmented. The culture is pretty cool with some really nice people but when you have had a bad day can be kind of demoralizing where everyone else's success is so hugely emphasized. That's chicken n egg situation - does it act as a driver for those struggling or does it demoralize those with potential further. Overall was an interesting & satisfying experience though.",

Communication between management was non existent through phone and texts.  . Many of the sales meetings were juvenile in manner and lacked the professionalism I have been so used to in the previous positions I have held from small local companies to an international consulting company I was with for six years. The only reason I had to leave was from an injury that kept me from being able to walk much. I would have stuck it out and hopefully developed my own team but right now is not the time. I sure hope the company does well and can see the needs of a proper sales training process is due. Best regards, Ron Valiquette",

            "For starters I didn\u2019t quit or choose to leave Vivint. I was in the ADA interactive process and received no communication that I was about to be terminated. I have been receiving medical treatment for ulnar neuropathy and cervicogenic headaches since November. I told my managers on more than one occasion that I was dealing with severe headaches that affected my ability to work and I was never given any options to talk to HR. The work culture itself was a cesspool of toxic masculinity. Rather than use meetings to discuss specific deals or give us analyicsl tools to manage our work, we played baseball in the parking lot, forced to participate in a pushup contest, and subjected to inspirational videos by Navy SEALs. Those kinds of things created a hostile work environment wherein any effort to get meaningful assistance from the managers ended with the solution of simply getting more new accounts and often questioning my work ethic. I worked at Countrywide yesrs ago and those managers were there to help new hires close deals. The managers in my office were great at sales but were not helpful at all when it came to second voicing customers. The manner in which Nick Hansen tried to fire me in October was disgusting and I would like to talk to someone about it. I was getting no salary and my dog was dying and he tried to turn my firing into this thing where he was doing me a favor. During that conversation he tried to fet me to agree to things that were simply false, such as the date of my hire and the number of accounts I had created. From the start Nick was unhelpful and simply focused on enthusiasm for the company rather than helping me and others advance accounts. He was also nowhere to be found for much of the time while I was there because of a new baby. \\\\In general I would have eliminated the pep rally meetings entirely and keep the office open at all times so we could go in there and work on accounts with an experienced manager. The fact that it is 2018 and we couldn\u2019t use salesforce to manage customers is simply unbelievable. The emphasis on sales games, video productions, and groupme is a total waste of time. It is like lighting time on fire and watching it burn. I do not need motivation to make money. I am not inspired by cheesy videos of coworkers. The groupme activity is a lawsuit waiting to happen. Making money is about being efficient and leveraging technology to make work easier. Making money is not done by ignoring awful conversion rates and organizational tools that improve efficiency on the margin. Exhorting sales staff to generate leads that can then be worked on by internal sales teams after the original staff member leaves is a cynical way to do business even though it is probably very profitable. \\\\In short I feel that my time at Vivint was wasted due to the fact that I had a tremendous amount of success getting new accounts and got zero support. Getting documents and consent is not easy. I was good at it and instead of helping me close deals I only got grief over ACs. I believe that residential solar can greatly improve household finances for most ratepayers and will always be disappointed by my lack of success at Vivint. That being said I believe the work culture needs to lose the Amway/Herbalife mindset. The competitive games destroy incentives to cooperate at the office level and just imagine the returns if Vivint spent that weekly video production budget on technology. I would very much like to have a exit interview in person and believe that Vivint should have offered me a job that accomodated my health situation before terminating my employment.

I was married in September so I didn't want to work 6 days a week, it's unhealthy for a family life as well as physical burnout. If scheduling wasn't so awful then maybe I could actually be home at a more consistent time. So maybe if scheduling wasn't from 8-4:30 (with no time for lunch, booked solid) then I would have stayed. Vivent should only have jobs scheduled from 8-3 or so because of travel time to first job and jobs not getting enough time to finish within the given amount. So if I could have worked Monday-friday, and reduce the everyday workload instead of always wanting more then I would not have left.  I was in the Woburn/Wilmington office. Because the company keeps on burning people out, it has gotten a bad reputation among electricians in the state which is why the company has to pay $47 an hour to get electricians. Tesla only pays electricians $35-$39 an hour but because it's a better environment, electricians stay there instead of going to Vivint. I only left Tesla because I was in N.H. and the N.H. shop didn't have enough work so I had to leave. From what I've seen, employees don't enjoy Vivint at all but when a company doesn't care about the employees having any kind of personal life, it's completely understandable.",

For example, I get home before 5  every day, if Vivint scheduled me so on average I could be home at 5 or earlier, and didn't want to force me to work Saturdays then I would have stayed. Pay was fine, I actually took a small pay cut to get away from too many hours.",

I was terminated without a warning or a real intent to learn what my problems could be.
