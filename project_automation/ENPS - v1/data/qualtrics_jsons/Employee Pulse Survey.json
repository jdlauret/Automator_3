I started working for this company because of my older brother who only said amazing things.  When I first began working for the company, I loved it.  Lately, it's been such a different place.  My older brother ended up getting laid off a couple weeks ago, along with 9 other techs from our office.  It's definitely a lonely place to work now.  It almost feels like there's no more hope  or happiness in the office.  Vivint Solar has always treated me great, and I'm very appreciative of it, but since this merge that's supposed to happen, I feel like Vivint lost sight of their employees and \"family first\" motto.",

The whole AB2FIN process is broken and is not functioning I don't think they way it should be as there are times that things to not make it to the proper buckets due to different departments have a huge back log which then makes a trickle effect and makes all other departments to have a backlog. I would like to see the company master all of the processes but they need to be functioning properly before we can have a positive outcome and I also believe that people who are deserving of it should be recognized for there hard work. I also believe that the office people do not get included in certain incentives that are run and that is not fair because office people work just as hard as the OPS crews and the Sales Managers and it would be nice to see incentives go out to the office crews as well such as the LIT's and the OA's.",

Some of this is tied to the pending transaction and some of it is tied to the number of individuals I've spoken with recently who have expressed their uneasiness and concern with their roles.  I see our dedication to Ops and Sales and I'm thankful for that, but I also see a lot of corporate employees that look at this like a job vs. career and I think that has a lot to do with a lack of clear career paths and overall interest from the company in the G&A positions vs. the Sales/Ops attention. Don't get me wrong, I know that Sales drives our business and I know that Ops closes out the work that Sales generates. In fact, I'm moving from being the HR Director over Sales to become a Sales Manager. But I know that in order for our company to truly thrive, we need an entire group of individuals (the entire company from top to bottom) bought into the culture, mission, values and excitement that many of our field folks have.  I'd love to see a more thoughtful approach to career paths, culture and recognition for our people and groups not in the field. Personally, the decision to leave HR and go to Sales was difficult.  I love interfacing with and helping Chance and his group.  I know the impact I've had in their area but at the same time, I feel like I can have a stronger overall impact on the company, culture, values and ultimately goals (MW Installed and Cost Per Watt savings) by going out into the Sales world and bringing my unique perspective and abilities to the field and eventually to Sales Leadership.

The reason I shared my answers the way I did is because this is a very sales based company. Understandably so, but because of this I feel that we are forgetting our purpose and what we are trying to accomplish. I would be worried to give a sales reps info to someone I have spoken with because I am worried they will be mislead or not taken care of. Very few do I feel that I can refer. I understand this is case by case and depends on the sales rep. I just want to feel confident when I hand them a card or give their information to know they will be taken care of. And that we dont just see people as a paycheck. I know we are a business and we want to make money, but I feel like the employees and customers get forgotten along the way. I appreciate you wanting to hear from us, and again, I am very grateful for the opportunities this company has given me. I hope that this helps!",

Additionally, non-sales personnel kind of feel that bonuses are beyond our control, our bonuses are hostage to how well the sales people perform, which is somewhat discouraging.

            "Vivint Solar is a great company. Although, the atmosphere is great in several ways, the communication is not so great and quite frankly some of the management isn't either. I feel that we as a company hurt ourselves with not following through or being too lenient on some. Not demoting someone because they are in a leadership position, from my experience has hurt teams and asks them to ignore an everyday issue. Which for anyone would be insulting. Vivint Solar has a lot of great things, as well! My personal team lead is amazing and does the best she possible can. Vivint Solar does a lot of things in regards to benefits that I am very grateful to have. I know a lot of people are nervous about the whole Sun Edison thing and have been in the dark for a long time. Hopefully we will get some clarity on that soon. Thank you for asking!",

            "I don't feel a part of the company because our management rarely communicates with me or my department. In the 7 months I have worked in the department I think my manager has maybe said 2 words to me. I don't think the executives above our department think of us as valuable or in-expendable.  I have rarely been given incentive to work hard or be better other than \"job-security\". I don't think that open positions are filled fairly. I think a lot of hiring decisions have been based off favoritism and not necessary skill or ability or even experience. Management is weak overall. I don't have doubts in upper management's skills or ability but I don't think we are being managed effectively on a personal standpoint. I don't know my manager, and I am confident he doesn't know me. To give him the benefit of the doubt, he may know me, but he has made no effort to demonstrate that.  This company can certainly benefit from more transparency. \\My last grievance is that a lot of attention and money is going towards the sales side of the company. I am more than aware that they bring in the revenue and that is especially important in this industry, but I am also aware that it costs a whole lot less to keep a customer than it does to find a new one.",

I also feel like most of the people I work with are content doing sub par work because the atmosphere is too lax and they see their superiors slacking off as well.",
            "One thing that concerns me about the culture here at vivintsolar is the mentality of each man or team for themselves.  At least in operations, there seems to be problems between departments.  Each department thinks they are the most important and they forget that to accomplish our company mission and vision we have to work together.  People tend to see our company through their department and what makes their jobs easier instead of what is best for the company.\\\\Also the lack of communication and accountability causes so many problems in this company in all departments. \\\\Sometimes I feel like we cut corners especially when rolling out new processes and tools.  I also feel like pushing for numbers is going to get you poor CADs, poor installs, incorrectly processed documents etc.  \\\\I am also concerned about the lack of training for leadership.  I have seen quite a few situations that were completely against HR policies happen between operations leadership and their teams.  We have a young workforce, with very limited experience and we haven't trained them to manage teams, issues, and often times most of them don't even know how to do the job their teams do.  That can cause a lot of frustration for the team members.  I personally don't deal with that anymore because of my position but because of my position I am aware of these experiences and frustrations.\\\\Another concern I have is the mentality that we promote people out of work.  I feel like this \"Mindset\" could correlate to the problems we are experiencing with employee moral, efficiency and other problems.  When leaders appear to not be working it makes it easier for team members to feel like they don't have to work. \\\\I love working for VivintSolar.  I can honestly say my experience has for the most part been positive.  But I know of so many who have not had that experience and I honestly believe that if I had stayed in operations I would have left the company a long time ago.  I feel like the departments in Lehi are headed in the right direction, but operations is struggling.  My biggest concern for this company is the influence leaders have on their teams.  Great leaders can impact teams to do amazing things but poor leaders hold the whole company back and I am of the opinion that a lot of the leaders (who directly work with teams: team leads, supervisors and managers) in operations are holding the company back.",

Visibility on inspections, scheduling thru Click, etc., needs to be the same. AB2FIN should be implemented by every team. \\\\CSM teams should have clearly set goals and incentives, however small, when goals are reached. There should be a clear career progression for CSMs so employees stay with us because they believe they can for years. \\\\We should also implement service to the community. Having been a beneficiary of Vivint Inc's Vivint Gives Back for my autistic son, they are changing lives for so many. I feel it helps employees feel like they really belong to a company when they can DO GOOD together.  Thanks, Greg!",

E.g., getting things submitted for utility approvals, scheduling inspections after install, etc. Recently certain steps in the process got put in the hands of the account managers but I feel that they are either over burdened with accounts or have a casual attitude toward them. there needs to be more clarity as to who is responsible for what in getting accounts to PTO. If I as the sales manager am responsible for getting accounts to PTO I am more than happy to do everything necessary but please give me the tools to do so. I shouldn't have to rely and wait on some single person who I may or may not be able to get a hold of, and who may or may not get back to me, or may or may not care very much. Either give me the ball or make sure the ones who have it want it. from where I am, it feels like unless I ride people's backs to get things done, they never would. I would rather do them myself. Another example: I had an account installed. Nothing seemed to be happening with its progression in a reasonable time so I emailed my account manager asking about it- he said it looks like it needs field work for the ab cad to be completed. He said he would email cad to find out what was needed to be done. Why did this have to wait for my inquiry to be taken care of or even noticed? What if I never asked? Would this have never been done? It's little things like this that have me concerned.",

            "To answer that fully, I need to back pedal a little bit. Growing up, I knew I wanted to be involved in the technology industry. As a young adult, I had the good fortune of coming into the alarm business early. I quickly discovered that hard work and dedication pays off well there and grew with it for seven years, supporting me through school.\\\\When the time came that I wanted to lay some roots and continue to climb, I turned my ship towards solar which I had been following for awhile and had been exploding. It would be an easy transition with my skill set and followed with my long term goals. \\\\This may sound silly, but as a scuba diver, outdoorsmen, and gardener, I have a great concern for how we handle ourselves and the impact of our role on this planet. And while we are a business, we are playing a positive part in all that that I am stoked to be a part of. \\\\All that having been said, I have a lot of personal investment in where we are headed as a company. I have been impressed with both our success in redefining the home solar business and creating the opportunity for so many families to be a part of something they wouldn't otherwise have the means to do so.\\\\The biggest things I have had on my mind lately are first, are we doing everything that we can be both locally (especially here in Utah) and nationally to raise awareness and educate both individuals AND legislatures about the benefits of solar. And second, where is our process at integrating new technologies such as the home battery.\\\\As far as myself, my only pressing desire would be to be involved with everything in a bigger way, on more than individual accounts.",

I can speak for a lot of people around me when I say we feel like we are completely in the dark with the future of this company. We do less fun things and there is much less of an emphasis on doing things as a team. I understand why, with the merger and us growing to the size that we are, but I feel like when I started with this company 3 years ago it was exciting to come to work and it felt almost like a club more than a job.

We are constantly being pushed to do much more work than we can physically do, and there is very little trust in our designers (my area) to do their job. I just feel like we are treated like machines that have to output X goal consistently or we're not doing our job, which is totally false. I look around at my team and see everyone working hard every day to do a good job, yet we are never able to meet our goals and higher-ups are constantly angry with us or having us work overtime to do the work of multiple people. The truth is, we have more work to do than we have people to do, and we can't be expected to just make up for that. Everyone I know here is trying hard to help people get affordable solar systems, but what we're asked to do makes it very stressful, and I know that, at least for me, I don't enjoy coming to work just to have everyone upset at me that I can't do the work of 3 people. Personally, this isn't the kind of place I want to work. I just want to be treated like a fellow human being, and I don't feel like that happens at the moment. I don't think this is a very family friendly environment. I get especially angry when I think about my supervisor, who consistently works 50-60 hours a week in order to make sure everything is getting done, but gets threatened every week with write-ups because we aren't meeting our goals. This is not a nice place to work, and I see that everyone around me is not treated very well. It is very frustrating to me.\\\\As far as the direction the company is going in, I really don't know enough about that to say. I don't know what kinds of things we're doing on the large scale, so I cannot say if I agree.",

I mean, I'm aware when new offices are opened and things like that, but I guess I don't really know what our direction is. As far as my job, I know that I am able to perform well - my problem is that I am expected to do more work than I am able to do. I don't think that what is expected of us is reasonable, and I think that goals need to be scaled down to actually be reasonable without expecting people to work more than 40 hours per week (or whatever one is scheduled to work). I am certainly made aware of what is expected, but even when I try my hardest (as well as everyone around me), we are often unable to meet these expectations. This is my problem with this company. I understand that the reasons behind these big \"quarterly goals\" or other large goals are hidden from the average worker, but I don't think they should be. I think everyone should know why we're expected to work ridiculous hours or meet impossible expectations. As far as I know, it's just because someone wants to pad their pockets with my hard work. I try to give the benefit of the doubt, but it would certainly help if everyone was made aware of the reasoning behind these goals and expectations. I don't think it is a healthy environment where we are expected to do the impossible without knowing why or even having much incentive to do so.",

I just look around at my team and I want a better work environment for them and for myself, and I don't think we have that. I don't think anyone enjoys this. We want to be treated fairly and we want to be listened to. Our work is as important as anyone else's, so why aren't we treated like that? Is our input really not important? I'm just frustrated with the state of things here, and I don't think it's very fair to anyone. I appreciate the chance here to speak what is on my mind; I'm just skeptical that anything will come of this. I'm afraid that it will only bring further justification, but no solutions. Or worse, that it will go ignored because I disagree with the way things are done here.

This company has taught me to embrace change & to be a leader in the revolution by helping others within the company. I know that the merger has created a lot of changes & has caused a lot of employees to flee because of the rumors about being laid off/fired. I only wish that someone would've spoken to us as a company to avoid those issues but we'll continue to be welcoming to the new hires. I enjoy working closely with other departments such as the local office, processing, interconnection,CAD, ESC, etc. I've always been that type of person to have a job that allows me to change someone else's world and I feel like Vivint Solar allows me to do that every day.",

I enjoyed training others about the positive effects this company has in this world & how they can be apart of it. \\\\I know that with the merger, everyone feels like there has been nothing but negative effects. For example, 2nd computer monitors being taken away, new hires receiving higher pay than those that were here longer, management favoritism, lack of inbound employees, techs getting laid off/fired out in the field, lack of care from the local office about the AB2FIN process, & issues with upgrades. I feel like with the merger, we need to come out with the positive benefits of doing that and refer back to the way things used to be. I guess just rebuilding that culture a year ago when it was welcoming, exciting, fun, hard-working, disciplined, & vibrant.",

As interconnection, we dip our fingers in just about every department to receive PTO. I think the rest of the company would do well to do the same.

They do work, but I do not see loyalty, I feel that some of them come here for just a paycheck and that management does not talk with us enough to make them fee loyal. We are told basic things, but we do not have the tools built to know what we need to do in every situation. This is difficult to do for any job especially ours, but we need some answers that can stand so we do not always have to send an email to someone who might know and wait for replies. It seems that my managers are too busy to do what their job description states that they should be doing.\\\\Just to be clear, the managers around me are wonderful people but they are not involved with us the way that they should be.",
            "When I interviewed with my manager I did not have the experience required to fit the \"minimum requirements\", because of a high recommendation he hired me anyway. He asked me how long that I planned to be here, I told him at least 2 years and I stand by that and I would love to work here much longer. I would hope that I can show my worth, and be here much longer than 2 years. \\\\I would really like to have a way to find out what is being done in our department and the direction it is going more often than once a year. I hear things here and there from people of what is going on but I almost never hear anything from management. It would be nice if employees could provide ideas in a group setting once in a while to help management do their jobs and possibly be able to help with projects to make managements job easier.\\\\It seems kind of odd to ask but having special assignments rather than more responsibilities would help make me and others feel more a part of this company and that we were actually needed as an individual. If I always feel like I could be replaced then I don't have much of a reason to want to stay here. I am sharing this not because it is a problem that I am having, it is because I have been given these responsibilities and I have seen the change that has occurred in my attitude towards this job.\\\\Thank you for your time Greg.",

I strongly believe in providing access to this alternative power source, Solar, to the masses, but I\u2019m never sure what direction the company is moving towards \u2013 very little visibility. I\u2019ve asked my direct supervisor where we\u2019re at with the past goals: price per kWh, Mwh deployed, the merger, etc. and more times than not, I\u2019m met with a lackluster answer \u2013 no fault to my supervision, he\u2019s great, but with so little information being offered I find myself wondering if the company is sustainable and that worries me, because I really, really, really love my job as a CSM. This fits me and my personality well, and because I love what I do, that always outweighs the negative parts of the company \u2013 mainly, the lack of communication. \\\\This is just an opinion, and I don\u2019t feel this is the forum to offer any suggestions for changes, just voicing my view.

And, if the company is operating with the end in mind, there is a lack of transparency. Is the goal of executive management simply to sell the company to the highest bidder?

I also think we need to be more patient with first year salespeople. Knocking on doors is a very specialized form of selling and it takes time to adjust and get comfortable with being so independent. I think we push a little too hard for results and the pressure forces new salespeople to not put in the time on the doors. They need some time to get experience on the doors. I think we lose too many potentialialy great people because we put to much pressure too soon. Just like taking professional sport rookies and demanding too much from them too early. We need to have a great training organization to develop all people to reach their full potential. I don't think we are there yet.

I also think the company could be much \"greener\" in the vegetable/nutritional sense of the word, there should not be muffins, soda, and chips laying around everywhere. Why is our company so obsessed with constantly providing copious amounts of soda and junk food to its employees? Green should start from the inside out. We should be working to create an environmentally friendly atmosphere/consciousness in the work place. There should be plants everywhere. We should be politically involved in environmental issues. I think Vivint Solar needs to start walking the walk, employees love flaunting the fact that we are a \"green company\" but we are not a green company in so many ways; we just have a green product. There is a difference.",

The system does work but not as effienciantly as it should.  The workflow between the different departments in many cases is difficult.   \\I think the problem with making the changes that need to be made is that many Corp leaders who don't really understand the entire process from A-Z fight the changes that would streamline the business because changes may effect their jobs.\\It's interesting that there isn't an attitude of continuous improvement and the attitude of trying to do things better than has been done in the past.\\I love Vivint and solar but it is hard to sell to the very best of my ability when I know for example many of our customers are being billed on an estimated basis because of Internet trouble or a bad envoy.   when the system is underproducing, thus overbilling the customer.  \\I'v ran into a few homes were only half of the panels are producing or all of them.  I'm serious... And we're billing them or not billing them at all.  So much lost $ because we really don't monitor this stuff.  And if there's a billing error it takes an enormous amount of effort to fix.  I'm not trying to be negative.\\My recommendation is that we really need to clarify what we are doing and what's absolutely essential to accomplish it and cut out and remove everything else.  \\Another quick example of the disconnect I see is the creation of sales materials.  Aka sales slicks.  It seems like those that have never sold an account or only have a superficial knowledge of the process are the ones creating the tools to sell the product.

However, as much as the company does for the employees (thank you very much) I would much rather have the company listen to me and my feed back then give me free soda. A few of us are over qualified for the positions that we hold, but continue on because we believe that we can work our way upward in the company and, hopefully, provide insite from someone who came from the trenches - as it were. I think it would behoove the company to find these individuals and ask for their input on decisions that affect the bottom echelons of workers here and how to improve processes, over come obstacles, and motive employees. Many of our ideas are cheap or free and would be very helpful. As it is, I feel appreciated, but ultimately interchangeable. - Kyle Vanderniet",

I know that we are supposed to co-ordinate with the local office, customers, and corporate departments to accomplish this.  However, as a phenomenally growing company resources are limited and instructions, training, and well formed expectations are either non-existent or are likely to become quickly outdated or obsolete as the company changes and job duties remain somewhat fluid. This leads to employees being overwhelmed and trying to do an adequate job for most of their accounts instead of superlative job for all their accounts. I know, and see, that some of the factors that contribute to this are being addressed as quickly as possible and that the \"top brass\" want out condition to improve but, the work force is simply stretched too thin and departments too antagonistic for employees to set their expectation above anything than mediocrity.",
            "I truly believe that all levels of management only want what is best for the company and that even the lowest level of employees want to be able to do a good job. I also know that when people don't feel they are able to achieve that or are at lest don't have access to the tools to do their work to a high level of satisfaction they begin to lower their own expectations and frustration rises. I also know that most employees want to effect positive change around the company and improve communication and work flow between departments. However, no one wants to be left holding the hot potato of blame and so point all their fingers at each other department. When in truth - everyone is understaffed for the growth of the company  and the vast majority of employees (down here) are not yet seasoned. The benefits that the company provides makes all of us very happy and make us want to continue to come to work, but the difficulties in our daily processes is a never ending source of consternation. \\\\There are some simple changes that would make a world of difference using only the resources we have on hand. There are many at all levels of the company, but especially the bottom, who would love the chance to present ideas for change and betterment of the company. Most importantly though, many aspects of the process are unique to states or even individual offices - allowing small amounts of approved diversion would be immensely beneficial to moral and productivity.",

Now with the merge I feel like it is all about cost per watt and the whole \"tribe\" mentality is out the window. I agree that we should work safe but feel that to be fired with a second write up is pretty harsh.I have seen alot of turnover of good workers who did alot for the company and now they are gone.It makes me nervous for my job instead of having a positive outlook.",

I wasn't taught how to do reports or things that the pilot teams learned or found to be helpful when creating Excel Spreadsheets to help them keep track of everything. It was more of okay here are your accounts go ahead and assign your name to the accounts and email all of your customers and good luck on figuring out how to be successful in moving those accounts forward. Coming from a specialty team things had changed and were more detailed and so it was a struggle just trying to understand what to look for and how to resolve the account to get it moving forward again. Things would have been smoother if I had known what to look for and what I am going to be required to do to help that account get their gears moving forward again before having the customer on the phone asking and we're just faking it until we make it.",
            "I think it's so very cool to be not just part of a job but part of a revolution. A revolution for change for cleaner, greener energy and it just makes so much sense to try and help spread solar all over to tap in to that solar energy that is abundantly available. It almost seems like it's a no brainer that solar is definitely a key in the direction to not just lowering our CO2 emissions but a smart choice to use the solar rays that would other wise be unused which is why I am glad that Vivint Solar is teaming up and joining Sun Edison in this massive cause and dream. This Thanksgiving weekend I shared with my younger brother my vision of how I see a day where everywhere you look rooftops are covered in some sort of prolific solar technology all around the world. So it's cool and even empowering to think that I am more than just an employee at a company, I am a ripple in this wave of change. However it is a struggle to be so overwhelmed with all the work as a CSM and the constant minor issues that seem to just be shrugged to the side or given the quick band-aid treatment. Since I was 17 when my parents got APEX I was amazed at the reps, customer service and the quick response time from Vivint. But now I don't talk to my neighbors about getting Vivint Security or Solar. I like the home-automation and the solar but I feel like the Company I know is now more about numbers which is important for growth and stocks. However with my southern roots I want less of a New Yorker attitude and more focus on quality and great customer experience. I want our amazing company to focus on cleaning up what accounts we do have and then striving to move forward strong again. It's like we're trying to win a sprint while also trying to tie our shoes during the race. I want us to get our running shoes on first and then run a marathon. I feel like it's a company where the attitude is \"just push it through\" and it's frustrating that I have lost trust in a company I love to the point where I don't want to push, sell and convince family and friends to get it because I don't want to infringe my relationship with them on potentially having them be over promised, no show appointments, constant work order rejections, long delay of getting to submitting interconnection after trusting me how highly I talk of the company over all the bad reviews to be disappointed. Maybe I am just ignorant to corporations and I have too high of expectations for my company and this is just how things are in large businesses but I refuse to have that attitude of \"that's just how it is\" and that is why my attitude has gone from strongly agree to just agree to my commitment because I have just been thinking of maybe taking the time to go study abroad since I think I need a break from this since I am not as Happy coming to work as I used to be. So I apologize to just vent and let it all out on how my role is frustrating on accounts not moving forward and how it's annoying that Work Orders missing or things just not getting done and etc. causing a issues in having a great customer service since I know it's a great company and the CSM role problems are just one other thing to what everyone else is dealing with and the many stressful things that you have to deal with however you asked me to be completely honest and to not hold back. Otherwise I have nothing but good things to say about the company and I look forward to when Vivint Solar has it's foundation down and solid and things start to move more smoothly which is why I keep helping and moving forward to help accomplish.",

Unfortunately I have seen how bad our operations and communication is from corporate to the field. We have really messed up a lot and created some very upset customers. It's a very low percentage of customers that go through the whole process without some sort of major failure along the way on our part. Our process has been so bad that it has been almost impossible for me to get referrals and create repeated business. Because of those reasons I can't give our company high marks. We shoot ourselves in the foot with our lack of communication and lack of ownership on progressing accounts. We are headed in the right direction with the CSM program but it's going to take a while for that to be where it needs to be. I love this company and I'm working hard every day to make it the best.",

            "Greg, I feel like Vivint Solar has several major problems. I have worked here for 2 years now and have seen several changes in the company. I trust that this survey is totally anonymous so without  revealing my identity I will tell you that my current position involves double checking the electrical work done by our installers and electricians. I have been doing this for about 7 months now and I can honestly say the electrical mistakes I have seen our electricians and installers make are scary but not as scary as the lack of concern the upper management has concerning them. Without going into too much detail about the specific mistakes it is suffice to say that they are blatant fire hazards which could result in death or serious injury to the customer. Some mistakes I see put the customer in risk of electric shock ( which can also cause death or serious injury) if their solar system were to be struck by lightning.   \\\\Now what I would expect to happen when a company finds out about these problems is they go back to EVERY home that has a problem and fix it immediately. Unfortunately what happens here at Vivint Solar is we discover the problem and decide to set a date about a month before we discovered the problem and say \"if this account was installed after this date we will go back out and fix it\". This is great except what about the other customers potentially in  the hundreds that still have these hazards installed on their homes? Are we really going let their lives be in danger just so we can make money off their systems because their system was installed before the ridiculous date we set going 1 month back?\\\\WE SHOULD GO FIX EVERY HOME! I understand that it will cost a lot of money and manpower and time to do this but IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO!!!!!!!!!!!! \\We need exceptional training and standards for our electricians in the field as well as our installers. If you say we already do I say you're sadly mistaken. The amount of simple mistakes I see on a daily basis that have the potential to become serious problems is concrete evidence to me that we definitely don't have exceptional training and standards for our employees in the field. \\\\Vivint Solar's current state of mind is Push accounts to PTO NO MATTER WHAT so we can start making money! We really don't care if their system was installed correctly or not, we don't care about the safety of our customers we just want their money. If it passes permitting it must be safe right??????? \\\\Because of this I am not proud to work here, The only joy I get from my job is knowing the work I have done for that day helped some of our customers be safer in their homes by catching mistakes we have made and taking steps to get them fixed.\\\\I would never let anyone in my family or my friends get solar panels from Vivint Solar, EVER.\\\\Greg, Have you looked our company up on the better businesses bureau?  I have and guess what? We are a complete joke! \\\\Lastly I would not recommend working for us to any friends or family because our pay is substantially lower than other companies in the industry. I still haven't gotten the raise I was promised once I moved to my new position. I understand that this is not anyone's fault because of the merger but I honestly don't expect to get that raise regardless if the merger goes through or not.\\\\\\I would love to see our companies vision change from getting tons and tons of accounts installed to focusing on installing them right. Who would you rather get solar from, the biggest solar company in the industry or  the company who is known for installing systems correctly and safely? \\\\Quality over quantity.\\\\\\I really hope this wasn't to harsh!",

            "I've worked here for 2 years and have seen an enormous amount of growth in the company. I feel there is a disconnect between the teams that work here at Corporate and those out in the field. It seems there is a lot of focus on Sales Reps, which is understandable considering we don't have a job to do if they're not out selling. However, too often, I see accounts that get installed without proper documentation being signed by the customer then received and approved by our Processing Department. There are always calls or emails coming in from sales reps that basically say \"can't you just push this forward?\". It isn't a big secret that they receive commission when an account is installed, and for whatever reason, they look for someone here to make an exception for them so that they can hit their numbers forgetting that if those exceptions are constantly made, we risk damaging our relationships with utility companies, investors, and ultimately customers (current and potential customers). What may seem like a small favor to a sales rep for our Processing or Customer Experience teams to move an account forward without all the proper steps being completed first, has the potential to a huge mess that Processing or Customer Experience has to clean up...and often WITHOUT the help of the sales rep.",

            "The Corporate Quality Assurance team started in February of this year. From February through July, we were on a streak of getting problem accounts moving forward. In that short amount of time, we were able to aid in getting just over 44 mW deployed. There were several different projects that we worked on and our work was noticed. In the Summer, it was announced that our team was basically being dissolved and that the new Customer Success Manager role would take on the responsibilities we once had to streamline the post-install to PTO process. What was and still is unclear is why a team that was able to achieve that much in a short amount of time was being dissolved so soon. Each of the 8 people on our team was given the normal workload that an entire team would handle (For Example: On my own, I had 500 accounts to review and push forward on a weekly basis. 2 team members had 700 on their individual lists, and another team member had close to double my number of accounts). Our very first week, we were given a project that contained close to 4,000 accounts that needed to be reviewed individually and placed in a bucket. Once we started on the project, we were informed that we had until that Friday morning to complete it. In order to meet that deadline, 5 members of the team worked their normal Thursday shift, then stayed to work through the night until the start of their normal shift the next day. In those few months with that original team, we constantly worked to build and improve relationships with those that we worked with both in the field and here at Corporate. In August, our team moved under the Processing Department. This happened shortly after the announcement of the SunEdison Merger and the transition from Customer Support to Customer Success. We feel a great sense of support here working under Myles Taylor and Malachi Hughes. However, because our moved happened in the middle of  other big changes in the company, we are still trying to get a good grasp on what our role as a team should be doing. There is so much good potential with what we can accomplish. I've seen it first hand. And I continue to see the great work that my team is able to do. Although there are times when our work seems underappreciated and our potential overlooked, my team continues to put out quality work and make the best of what they're given.",
            "I absolutely love where I work and what I do here. I appreciate the team I am on and want to see it succeed. I feel like there is definitely a need for our Corporate Quality Assurance team and with the right structure and overall support, there is no doubt in my mind that we can be a great asset to the company like we were in the beginning of the year.\\This is a great place to work! I've been here for 2 years and have enjoyed it so far!",

            "The chain of leadership for me seems to constantly try to sell me on that the processes aren't that bad. They often compare our office to other offices and tell us how good we have it. They also compare our company to other solar companies and say they experience the same things. As a sales rep my ideal mentality is to get things done and not make excuses but if the example set by my direct superiors is to constantly make excuses for why things are the way they are and not have any idea on when/how/or why they are going to get better, it allows me to lose site of the goal.",
            "Greg,\\\\I'm a sales rep, my feelings about the job and about the company change frequently. Some days I wake up and feel as though I am able to take on the world. I process through whatever accounts I have and send emails or make phone calls to get the accounts to whatever the next step is in the process. Then I go out to area and knock. Some people tell me \"no,\" other tell me \"not right now,\" and on a good day one or two people tell me \"yes.\" After a few hours of knocking, if I have a design to show or someone to follow up with, I'll go do that. Then when I'm done in area I'll go home and reflect on my day and analyze where I could have improved or done something different. That would describe a good productive day.\\\\Unfortunately lately those types of days are few and far between. The types of days I've been having lately (6-12 months) focus so much less on customer facing opportunities and creating/selling accounts and mainly on trying aimlessly to put out fires with current accounts leading up to install and/or accounts that have already been installed. The amount of time, energy, effort and focus that goes into maintaining accounts and trying to keep them happy greatly outweighs my time spent generating new business. \\\\The ESC process has been a nightmare in my office. Months go by after install before the ESC is done. I've been trying to give my customers realistic expectations and if they need an ESC I've had to start prepping them for a 6-12 month install to PTO wait time. The process from install to PTO hasn't been very smooth either. All too often after install issues arise causing a delay in PTO. From missing IWOs/EWOs, to the processing department not being able to upload documents in a timely fashion, to everything being ready for inspection but the account just sitting for weeks before inspection is scheduled. Frequent phone calls I get from customers sound like this, \"Hey, I've been installed for over a month and no one has reached out to me to let me know what's going on, I was told I would get a phone call or email telling me to turn my system off in three days and I never got that phone call. When is the inspection going to happen? When will my system be working? Why is it that it seems like you guys work really fast to get the panels up on my roof but after that it seems like you don't care about is anymore?\" When I get these types of calls it zaps my motivation, my drive and mostly my desire to go out and do MY JOB, which is selling accounts and taking them to install. Me not out working and creating accounts and in turn not installing as many accounts as I used to is something that I take responsibility for. Personally searching for reasons and answers to why I'm not out working and installing as many accounts per week/month/quarter/year as I am capable of, has led me back to the same spot and asking my self the same questions time and time again. \"Does the company really care about the customer once the panels are installed?\" \"Even though I personally am doing everything in my power to give my customers a great experience and representing a company that provides a great product, are the processes of the company going to get better than they are now?\" \"Am I a good salesman for a company that has lost sight of how important it is to continue to provide a great experience for the customer?\"\\\\As of now I am not ready to leave the company, but I contemplate it weekly and I am not alone. The company has so much potential marginal benefit that is being lost from unhappy customers. It's something I battle with customers on a regular basis. A company is only as good as it's employees and the culture they foster. We have really good people who work for this company, but as a whole, as an aggregate, I feel the company is severely under performing on its promises. I believe this is what's leading to the answers on this survey. \\\\Greg, if you actually do read this, I appreciate you taking the time to hear my coments and concerns. Thanks.",

            "I'm a CAD facilitator. You can know who I am. \\When I got this position I came from being a CAD designer making around $11/hour to $13.50. For a week it seemed like a big raise, until CAD re-structured pay and CAD designers then made $12.50. I was barely making more than the new hires I was training! And a dollar less than Lead Designers, who make $14.50. It was a slap in my face that I was making so much less than lead designers. My manager, couldn't do anything about it at that point, nor could he change anything later when a Lead Designer became a new facilitator and kept his $14.50/hour pay. A person who just started my job was making (and is still making) a dollar more than me!\\Months later, when a new CAD position was created (a Training Lead), a position that would in many ways be below my own, the pay for that position would be $14.50/hour. Someone on a lower level would be making more than me! Of course I applied to that position, and when the pay of the new position was brought up to Steve Roy, he said no to a raise for my position. I got the training lead position, but before I could take it HR was upset that CAD made a new position, so the position was cancelled. (Ask yourself if you'd go crazy at this point.)\\So I was back making still the same pay as when I began the position, still less than a Lead Designer, and less than the person who started after me. And I've talked to CAD supervisors, and I could even go back to being a basic CAD designer and make the same pay I'm doing now. Isn't that insane?\\\\Then my manager assured me that when the new Director of Training came in, he'd be able to offer raises because he was no longer under Steve Roy. That didn't happen. Maybe it will, with some of the training re-structure, but who knows. I like my job, but all this hasn't given me a whole lot to be confident in. I'm hopeful things are getting ironed out, but that's been the biggest frustration.\\\\But it just feels like the company is so driven for results and reaching goals, and we have these lofty aspirations...but are we giving people the respect they deserve? If we're so successful as a company, are we putting that success in the right place? If we want to keep doing business and managing the company the same way companies have been doing for the last hundred years, then fine. But don't tell us to \"Lead the Revolution\" unless you're really going to change the way a company does business and treats it's employees.",

Unfortunately I feel this is the first time since I started that we didn't have an identity or vision.. Guys don't know if we are Vivint, Go, or SUNE\\\\31G was a great Vision.. We had a \"smart\" goal.. We knew if we wanted to hit this goal we would need to double in size each year which meant a double in opportunity.. Now we don't really know what we are or what the goal is\\\\Aside from that, all of the constant changes from corporate to the sales process have seemed to make things way more complicated rather than more simplified \\\\In New York we have a notary step.. In order to submit a permit we need to call corporate and schedule a time for the notary to come by.. This is the most important step to the sales process because it translates to a \"sale\" and we currently can not schedule a notary unless it's Monday through Friday from 9-5pm\\\\reps are taught not to close CAD's during that time because they are prime knocking hours, so if we close a cad later in the day after 5 we need to schedule the notary the next day, completely taking the situation out of our control.. That is painful to the process\\\\I know we will get through it, and I will keep on being positive and helping guys reach their potential but things have been harder lately for sure",

However I also have some misgivings about some things i had unforeseen but that I and my customers have experience that left me feeling embarrassed and through which I lost some confidence in our company. Some very important customers to me suffered what seemed to me to be an Interminal series of inane in competencies and lack of professionalism, in their eyes. These are all due to dropped balls, lack of communication and lousy procedures in place internally. My OMs assure me that these are anomalies due to extremely fast growth over the summer. I tend to believe them. Perhaps my faith was just too high based upon my years of experience with a small solar contractor with a reputation for high quality finish work  and customer attentiveness. So I've adjusted my expectations of Vivint Solar to be a bit more realistic, given the highly compartmentalizations and insulated divisions of duties. \\\\Im also concerned that those at the top may be poised to become the sort who feel they are improving the company by squeezing down on perks and benefits while demanding more of us. When at first I was attracted to how gracious and generous compensation seemed to be.,This is only a sense and I don't point to any specific instances yet. Albeit, we seem to be having fewer team lunches and other little team building perks. \\\\On the whole, however, I know I'm working for and with a great bunch of people who are working hard and collaboratively to be a superior company.  \\\\And I too, have watched \"12 O'Clock High\" and know when and how morale and management need to be toned.

Being an independent contractor feels more like clinging to the outside of a Lear Jet. You get to say you are with the company and going just as fast, but it's a hell of a lot colder and you really have to cling on. Yet I'm not sure I'd like it all to change to salary plus bonuses either. \\\\So, that is on my mind but haven't processed it all through and not sure how I come down on it.",

As more guidelines for safety, quality, speed, production, etc are in stated our jobs are constantly being made more difficult, longer hours, less concern for our opinions and lively hood. We are the ones that physically make the job a reality and have the most physically demanding aspect of this career, yet all the changes taking place seem to put more pressure and strain on us.

            "Hi Greg. I'm the OM from the pioneer valley office in MA. I wish in this survey I could add comments to each question. I love this company and always put 110% into my job, but the last month or so has been crazy with all of the changes and last minute notices. I'm short staffed and now feeling micromanaged. I also feel sales Reps need to be more accountable as just like the rest of us as a team. We are all heading in the right direction but at the end we all need to be On the same page. Also with the all new changes including safety we need to take it into consideration of how install will take longer. I could go on but it would be a book. That being said I love the company and can't wait to see what 2015",

Our conversion rate from sale to PTO is getting worse not better. With all the changes we are making our ability to move accounts forward is not improving. IT had made managing accounts much more difficult. Everything that IT rolls out is a nightmare and makes my job more difficult. After a new IT item rolls out my coworkers and I have to spend the next several weeks fixing the process IT just broke. \\\\We can overcome these challenges.

The issue that most applies to this page is, that when processes are changed or implemented company wide processing and most other groups who will have to execute the process are not brought in until the end. When it is to late to take their input to improve the new or changed processes. If you want buy in across the company the various groups need to buy in must be heard before you ask them to buy in. You don't need to do what they want or get consensus but the groups need to give their input and be heard. An example of this is the recent As-built to FIN process. The teams in the field are not following the process. They are not following the process because they were not included at all in planning, creating and implementing the process. Its not easy to implement new processes correctly but failure to do so is very costly.",

It seems to be the case that IT is the final arbitrator when it comes to designing and implementing business processes that my group and other groups are responsible for and must execute on a daily basis. This results in deeply flawed processes that require workarounds and drain our company of resources. The most costly resource we loss is good people who get burned out and lose confidence in our company.",

            "I have been very optimistic and devoted to the company in times past but struggle to do so now. There has been so much confusion lately about the new processes, who is supposed to do what, and disappointed customers who have been left behind while the local office struggles to get things done right and in a timely manner.\\Many older accounts are left in the dust, while newer accounts get the attention. I think the oldest account, that has been waiting for a long time, should have their work done first. The local office takes way too long to follow up with undone work.\\With the new CSM position, we were told that the pay would be high, and our status would be at a manager level. When I was offered the position, I was told that because of the merger the pay would be lower. This was a disappointment. My experience since then has been extremely stressful. Almost everyday there are processes that don't work correctly. Every week my Google Doc isn't correct. I have 150ish accounts that I need to contact every week with no overtime allowed. The majority of my accounts are stuck in ESC processes or don't have the As Built done and require a lot of follow up. The Tech's continue to not send in all the needed photos on a regular basis. \\The work load is not humanly possible, and yet the accountability is still there. On an ongoing basis, we continue to find out that we are responsible for more and more that other departments used to do ie canceling accounts, re-activating accounts, website help, generating system ID's, building the systems in Enphase and Solar Edge, activating accounts at PTO, etc.\\I feel a CSM should be able to tap into the other departments to help us take care of the customer, not take over the other departments responsibilities, in addition to the many we already have.\\Most of the time, we just suddenly discover we have one more thing we need to do, but have not received any notification or training for it, and the departments that used to do the task won't help. So much is unsettled and instead of getting better, it gets worse.\\Many times I have hung in there for company transitions, I have no problem with that when there is hope at the end of the tunnel that a brighter day is coming soon. Lately, I feel so beaten down and disrespected. The pay does not come close to the intense work load that keeps ever increasing. The mountain is too high to climb because of the chaos. The As Built to FIN has made little difference in my office. The main problems still exist, EWO's and IWO's are not completed on a regular basis, the local office doesn't have enough Electricians for the work load, the Work Orders department is not getting things done in a timely manner and our missing As Built list is huge.\\I felt so optimistic and had high hopes for things to evolve. Now I feel so beaten down. Everyone on my team has similar feelings, and because of the extremely high stress, many of us have been getting sick for some time now.\\\\With the merger, we are all very anxious to know how this will affect us. We have an interest in knowing how close we are, November was the last date mentioned. What can we anticipate in regards to the Health Insurance, especially with the Vivint Clinic access ending. What's the progress on the new buildings? In order to stay excited about change, we need more information about how things are moving along. This way we feel like we are still on the train to somewhere, instead of forgotten.\\I want to stay because I have a great team, and they make it worth it. The truth is, my mind wanders to other possibilities because it feels like I'm on a sinking ship. \\We really do treat many of our customer's terribly. As a CSM, our hands are often tied because we can't offer more than what the local office will do.\\I wish we could stop the Installs for a week, so we could focus on the all the backlog to get a fresh start in serving our customer's in a timely manner. I would like to see more company integrity.",

CSM's in particular have thrown a huge wrench into our workings at the worst possible time for our backlog due to poor understanding of what they do, and what us processors do. As well, though it's understood that everything with a merger is either \"I don't know, not until later, I can't promise anything\" and lots of bad news about Sun Edison. There's a lot of gossip and not a lot of input from our leadership about what's going on ( frankly, because they might now know themselves.) Despite all of this, I'm proud to work here!

Most of the resources that I do need are available but every now and then I run into a problem that is dealt by a different department but still as a CAD designer I should know how to properly deal with the problem rather then pass it off to someone else. I honestly have no clue what is expected this next quarter for the company, I do not know how well this company is doing or even who we're partnered. I have heard rumors flying around here and there but nothing solid. My fellow employees are committed to a point. They do their jobs and reach expectations but there is nothing that really drives or pushes them. There is nothing intrinsic about their motivation and the recent incentives have really only focused on singular people and for a short period of time. That's great if you want to reach numbers for a certain week, but you can't always run at 110% if you want to reach a quarterly goal. With constant changes it's difficult to keep one goal because some changes can completely change how you work. My supervisor does keep me well informed on a lot of things but there are some questions that I have asked that not even he could answer, he would tell me that he has not received information on that so it's unclear on how we would move forward in certain situations. I feel that there are too many people being left in the dark about a lot of stuff or information is being passed around too much and it just becomes a game of telephone and a \"that's what he said\" situation. I used to receive information about what was going on in the company and it made me excited to know that what I was doing is worth it and that the fight for clean energy was going somewhere but in recent times, I haven't received anything. I would also like to know if our solar panels have really helped someone. Just like how vivint security would send out emails about how customers thanked and appreciated them, I think it would be nice to receive something like that about vivint solar. Knowing that I'm making a difference and seeing that I'm helping people really drives me to work harder.",
            "I am a CAD technician and I have been with the company for almost a year now, within the time I have worked here I have actually been able to learn and grow, and also become the fastest designer on my team. I owe all of what I learned to my trainers, supervisors and team leads and I thank vivintsolar for giving me the training and opportunity to become an efficient CAD designer. \\\\There has been a point in my career where I started to wonder if what i had been doing really mattered, or if I was really just someone who could be easily replaced. The latter is still true but I do love this job so I hope I'm not replaced, but when I first started I loved pushing myself, seeing how much work I could get done, what my fastest CAD was, how much work with so few mistakes I could get finished and it went pretty well. I became the fastest designer on my team but with just those bragging rights it started to feel like that's all I was, just a good worker, my motivation started to drop and my work suffered but I looked to see what else I could do and what else I could learn. I read the books Drive and A Whole New Mind by Daniel pink and I started branching out to see what else I could do to help my team. I started learning some electrical, answering phones and emails, doing redesigns, and many other things. I noticed that not very many people in my department have that intrinsic motivation to do work, to challenge yourself, and I know a lot of the higher ups noticed it too and did incentives. The incentives worked for short term goals but either the department ran out of money for the incentive or people were just not pushed by them, when they were done, a lot of people just slipped back into old habits. I feel like this job and company is very team and goal oriented but it feels more like it's concentrated on a singular persons success rather then a team.\\\\I used to work with vivint security and the things that really stuck with me most was their sayings like \"One team, one goal\" and \"Be better today then you were yesterday, be better tomorrow then you are today\". I don't really feel that comradery here, I feel more isolated and that a lot of people are left in the dark about the goings on in the company. As a CAD designer we prep all of the packets to be sent to the customer and permitting. About a month ago I had an electrical training to see how much I know about the electrical because we design the three lines and some of the electrical for every system. Most people in that training had no idea what went into a design electrically, the trainer that was a head electrician for vivintsolar seemed almost astounded that we are designing things that we had no idea about. I feel like that shouldn't happen. \\\\I've heard rumors about vivintsolar and that's what I really hope they just are, is rumors. I do love working for this company, I'm excited to see where it's going, amazed by how fast it's grown, and happy that I'm able to be a part of this clean energy movement. I'm still striving for success and am always glad to come in to work. Thank you for this amazing opportunity.",

I just don't sell intellectually and so I don't talk about savings or how much their new bill is going to be. Its just cheaper cleaner energy! The biggest issue with having them sign everything before the CAD is that they aren't mentally there yet and it gives me time to get them there! All other areas we are going is awesome though.

We have great leadership and i appreciate all the handwork and unseen hours that they put in to make this opportunity what it is! So now for what i would change or be careful of in the future is being something we are not! The reason I came to VSLR from Sun Edison and Complete Solar was because of process and how I sell. I sell very conceptually! I don't talk about savings, panel size, inverter type, or any of that stuff! It cripples consumers when guys do that! Customers start becoming analyzers! And then before you know it they get analysis paralysis!! i.e. \"let me think about it!\" We will sell more if we train our guys better on this concept. I am worried about doing design tools and putting to much in the hands of sales reps like programs to design and show the customer what it will look like! It will not help customers make decisions and will only provide a crutch to average or below average salesman! I have seen it first hand with complete solar and how it hurt guys that with a little better skills would of been great! I don't use slicks and i don't use videos or graphs cause that is not how people choose or buy. They just want to know it is the right decision and feel good about it! They will buy off of emotion and sell themselves after you leave because it makes sense. More info only confuses them more! Anyway this is an amazing company and I am so grateful to be apart of it! It is and will continue to change my life and the people around me! 31G!!!",

            "I am proud to do the work that we do, but would like to see a more committed effort to the sustainability of the entire process. In specific, I feel that more emphasis could be focused on the recycling of our waste products including cardboard, steel, and alluminum. When I see these materials discarded in the trash daily it irritates me since I know that a great deal of energy and raw materials go into the manufacturing of such products. As a leader in the renewable energy industry, it is doing a diservice to allow for such actions to take place. I do understand that we have the ability in most cases to recycle these products, but have found that the process is being compromised due to factor that are unexpected. Perhaps an incentive program or something of the alike could be put in place to emphasis a focus on issue. Thanks for the opportunity to voice my concern. Hopefully we can continue to improve upon the great path that we are on.",

            "Working in sales has been up and down as anyone would expect with a sales job. I feel extremely valuable to the company. I have felt that as a company, Vivint solar does try so hard to make my job easier and more efficient. I have been with the company for 2 years now and I have seen great movements forward. I trust the leadership and the direction that the company has chosen. Somethings that make me nervous though has been our operations turn over and customer support after I hand them off to corporate. I would have put strongly agree if I trusted what's happening with the operations more. I was an operations manager with Vivint.inc. I always try to see both sides of the workforce, I feel like being in the operations side to be risky and not necessarily fair. The work load put on OM's needs to be spread out better. In Bmore we have have gone through 5 OM's in the 2 years we have been open. I know this has not been unique to our office. Operations turn over is high. On another note, they are often pressured to do work that is dangerous. I.e. Install in the rain and snow.  I helped the techs do a install on a good day and it was hard to take panels up a latter. When it's wet it's even more dangerous. Me personally I would never accept those working orders and I would not want a friend or family member to be a installer. If we called more jobs because of bad weather I would have much more faith in the company. I have had several customers that are stressed sick watching our crews work under those conditions, I have had a tech fall off a icy roof. Another tech slice his leg open because a deck was wet and the later slipped. I didn't  vocalize these concerns to anyone before because I didn't think I would be heard. Seems like we are install, install, install. Which is good. But safety first so we don't wreck some of our employees ability to work in the future because injury.",

It was so much fun, every month there was activities as a region or office the involved the whole family. \\2015 has been ok, but definitely a lot less focused on the whole family, and also less focus on the team. The top performers have been getting a lot of exclusive treatment. I feel like our synergy as a company and individual offices has been negatively impacted for this culture change. \\In my mind I can hear myself saying \"anyone can point out problems, leaders provide solutions.\" \\I say we get back to the basics. Every quarter, have a wife's night out where they send the wife's out on the town. When we first started that was the norm. Now it's stopped.\\Every quarter, have a office family activity. I.e. Pool party, Christmas party, office bbq. No stings attached, if your part of the team, your family is invited.  \\This job is not a job about being super talented, it's a job about having emotional and mental health. I find that these type of activities provide a getaway from the stressful parts of the job and give a jump start on success.

            "I love putting money back into peoples' pockets rather than convincing them that my product will only cost them a few dollars each month.  I love making a difference for them financially long-term with the increased value of the contract due to the projected price differential over time.  I love sharing the vision of our children's future with them, and creating one-on-one relationships with them so they feel like I'm a friend in a discussion, not a salesperson with an agenda.  I can find common ground and share and cultivate their passion about the financial aspect, the reduced weight on the grid, and/or the global impact in this small setting.  Regarding \"moving in the right direction,\" I have never really been comfortable with global monopolies, so the merger has never really felt as comfortable.  However, if we can continue to positively impact individuals' lives while being part of a more global company, then I can work with and continue to be passionate about this.",

            "In my humble opinion and limited experience, the company has no sense of urgency to get from installation to production.  40% of our installed accounts are in DataComm Failure -- just 2 weeks ago it was 70%.  I see this as a *system problem* -- either that department is understaffed, not equipped with the tools necessary to see the problems and respond efficiently, or the company doesn't make enough on production to invest the resources (people/equipment).  This reflects directly on me personally, since the customers have become my friends as well as my sources of referrals.  And it reflects on the bottom line for VivintSolar, since referrals take 1/2 the time to generate and 1/2 the effort to convince, resulting in higher numbers for the company.  So it is counter intuitive to cut corners in the last step.  \\This dovetails into my comments regarding knowing what we need to do this quarter.....I know that I need to sell.  I know that the success of the company depends on me getting sales into and through the funnel to installation.  I get sales by creating relationships with people excited about using solar (for whatever reason).   I thought the company was committed to getting solar working, but my numbers of working systems versus DataComm Failures don't reflect that yet.  This currently doesn't appear to be the company's focus, therefore I must not comprehend what is necessary for the company to succeed this or any quarter.  Are we in this for the federal tax credits and RECs, or for the $$ AND making a difference by getting working solar on peoples' homes?   \\\\The software transitions have been a little bumpy out here on the sales edge.  We are excited about the new software's potential, and cringe at it's arrival knowing it's going to be painful debugging.  And we are grateful for the effort to improve our tools.   Here's hoping the next upgrade is around long enough to allow us to get the bugs out and use it a while.  :)\\There seem to be some hand-off gaps.....when an account goes without any problems, the \"conveyor belt\" automated passage through the design process seems to work well and they get through to Structural Review pretty smoothly.  However, any hic-cup or problem (ie partial surveys, usage submitted after site survey completed, etc), the account falls off the conveyor belt and must be watched/hand-carried step by step to ensure completion.  It would be great to find a *system solution* way to re-set the account onto the track and get it back into the automated production line. \\\\Morale seems a little challenged due to the wage adjustments on installers, site surveyors and leads (I don't know about other offices/departments).  I don't know the hard numbers, but in general, it feels like playing with the big dogs means scraps & crumbs for more of the workers.  Typical large corporation profit numbers games --- increasing the profit margin the easiest way possible -- cutting staff, wages, benefits for those generating the revenue, cutting the denominator, versus increasing the numerator, sales.  I recognize we couldn't generate the revenue without the opportunity provided by the company.    Still seems like VS is cutting it's throat for a few pennies.  As a former HR director, I know how costly employee turn-over is --- and I can only guess that it has been much higher since the wage adjustment.  And I think I can tell from my own numbers that overall productivity may have decreased.  But I don't have enough experience (ie seasonal adjustments/fluxuations) to know definitively.\\It is currently 10pm and we just got word from a customer that he got HOA approval.  We want to schedule his install, but no one is answering in the CSM department.  Our CSM's hours are 9-5:30.  It would be helpful to have at least one CSM available (Very experienced one if I could make a suggestion) 8am-10pm local time, since many of our customers work and we often do the admin before and after knocking/appointment hours.",
            "Both myself and my husband are Sales Managers.  I do most of the back-end things while he creates most of the accounts.  I spend hours daily managing the bucket list.....ensuring CAD activity logged, status of permits, HOA requests and interconnect, researching reasons for holds, tracking down emails asking about holds, status checking hold removal, etc.  We have approx 140 total accounts between the two of us at this time, including cancelled and hibernated.  Honestly, I don't believe that any one person can actually track 150 accounts, especially not if you tack on pre-CAD approval responsibility as well.",

I'm not educated on the exact process but I know that making multiple trips out to the consumers-residence to satisfy investors requirements (i.e. photos) puts the end product in a less than desirable position to be referred. We should be able to PTO the consumer to satisfy them asap and button up everything else on a service call within a week or whatever parameters are acceptable.

            "The only resources that would make me more successful are more direct communication so that I know when things like inspections and PTO is scheduled. These two things appear on my calendar, sometimes after the fact which prevents me from keeping my customers in the know. \\\\In terms of the company's needs to be profitable, I didn't know that the designs that are idle or active would be redesigned by cad if they were on the new jinks panels. If I had known this, I would have hibernated more of them to save that effort. It also relates to the SunEdison merger, but if there is a specific goal within the company that is needed to show value to keep that deal going through, that could motivate me. \\As far as fellow employees, I know that there ar folks at my office that are doing an amazing job. Some had been great role models for me to be successful. The 3 DMs at my office are amazing and they all have different strengths.\\On the operations side, there have been sloppy or incorrect site surveys that have caused customers to get something different than the design they approved when we met. It is as if they aren't getting exactly what they thought and making a 20 year commitment to that. One of our regular site surveyors was out of town and the person we were loaned from another office had inaccurate measurements on every single survey he took. Luckily, I installed 4 of them, but not without day of install changes that included big discrepancies in the solar power offset.\\There have also been a number of sloppy mistakes on install. I went to a customers house and I saw screws hanging through on the eaves which missed the rafters. It was 20 feet up, but noticeable if you know what to look for andirons was on the front of the persons house. I've got several exposed beam jobs I am working on, and I fear the craftsmanship won't be equal to the task.\\Company information is regularly sent through. I probably have enough info to keep me happy.",
            "I feel supported in my job. But, when push comes to shove, It is all up to me, I go out there by myself and create accounts and get installs. I was excited about the referral program and have sent out links to many folks, built profiles for customers, and shared it to spread the word.  The feedback I have gotten from customers is that the site is not working and they can't add in referrals. So I've told them They will get $250 if a referral gets installed, which is a premium, but I have to manage it all on my own. So an update on when that will be repaired and operational would be great. As of today I am not telling anyone else about it. \\I also wanted to send an email about this to you! Solar city has sponsored Facebook ads that give folks an opportunity to sign a petition regarding the future of net metering in CA. I want to support the rooftop solar industry, but I don't want to support solar city in my fb feed. Could Vivint sponsor something similar to share? The fate of Net metering in California is critical to our success.\\I appreciate the opportunity to make money saving the planet with Vivint Solar.",

            "With respect to personal advancement and opportunities to grow, I feel that Vivint Solar is lacking. Having substantial time with this company, I have seen numerous policies regarding raises and promotions implemented, changed, withdrawn, and discarded. Without going into specifics, I feel that  Vivint Solar used to provide its employees with a clear cut policy of how to personally advance through hard work, diligence, and productivity. Raises were assigned based on skill and merit and awarded to those who met the designated requirements. They motivated employees to work harder and hit goals to be rewarded. Currently, I observe an absence of motivation from many employees. There is no recognition or merit based on compensation for someone who goes  beyond the minimum. Sadly, many choose the minimum because the reward is the same for both ends of the spectrum. I really do love this company, and have enjoyed the time I have invested with this company and the vision it posses to provide clean energy to the masses. I simply feel, with a few tweaks, a significant proportion of the workforce could be motivated to perform better, and be compensated for it.",

It's frustrating for me to sit here everyday and have the upper management push us and push us, yet they haven't sat in our shoes. I feel like the company just wants numbers and doesn't really care about their employees. I've never worked for a company and felt the way I do. For months I didn't want to come to work because a Co-worker was bullying me, but it was all turned on me and was all my fault. I just don't feel like people take their employees seriously. Everyone isn't treated equally. When my husband was diagnosed with cancer, his supervisor tried to get in contact with hr to be able to get our GoFundMe account emailed out to the company because he wasn't allowed to work very much anymore. We never got an answer back and days later someone else's got sent out. I just don't see the uniform equality here. I like working here it's just frustrating sometimes. \\\\thanks",

            "I have been with vivint Solar for about 3 years and have recieved nothing for my efforts. I used to be driven, motivated, and getting better numbers than most others. I started in CAD, then went to pre-design, usage, and not back in Design. All the time the idea of \"great opportunity to grow with the company was getting thrown in my face that I kept buying. But I have received nothing but bad luck, crappy and hypocritical leaders (Carter and James especially!) and NO opportunities to grow with the company. I am currently looking for better employment.",

            "If there is one thing I have learned at working for Vivint Solar, that is that the ability to communicate information is awful. I feel like every day there is a change or a miscommunication. How are we as Designers or in any department supposed to find a smooth system to design with if the system is constantly getting changed. Not only that, half the time I am hearing things the first time from co-workers or even people on other teams before I hear anything from my direct supervisor.",
            "To be honest, there are 3 reasons I am currently looking for a new job.\\1. Poor leadership. I would say the two people that have rubbed me the wrong way is Carter Howe and James Nelson. Both of them are hypocritical, deceiving, immature, power abusers (almost fired me for something so small and stupid when the majority of the blame should have been my team leads fault) who have sucked up their way to be some of the \"top dawgs\" in the CAD department. I know they may have great skills that benefit the company and maybe those things are taking precedence, but as an employee under them, it makes my job awful.\\2. The lies of opportunity. I have been here for 3 years now and have heard the talk about opportunity from day one. I have tried so hard, spent countless of overtime hours to increase numbers and get more things done. When I was in Pre-design I continually wow'ed my leaders and did my job well, then found out they were dissolving Pre-design, so I switched to CAD (where I was much worse at my job). Then I found out the company just juked me out and did not get rid of predesign but I felt there was more \"opportunity with Design, so I stayed and tried to \"grow with the company. Nada. No opportunities. Because CAD is full of suck ups and the only way to grow is to be in a click of some sort, or know everything about CAD. (which I don't). \\3. the Pay. I have a new born baby. I am trying to provide for my family. When other companies are paying their CAD techs $15-$18 an hour and I only get $12.50 an hour. It's kinda sad. \\\\I need a job I enjoy, that pays well enough to not live paycheck to paycheck with my son and wife. So I am done here and looking for greater opportunities. As soon as I find that job, I will be gone. My experience with Vivint Solar was not too bad in the beginning over when we were by vivint Inc. But the past year or so has really rubbed me the wrong way and has not been a good or fun experience in employment.",

Which is after the morning shift has gone home for the day meaning and only finds out about it the next day.  This has reduced the amount of people who would come in on those extra incentive days than if they were given even a few days notice instead of one day. Many people by that time have made plans for the weekend and are unable to change those plans as they have either already paid some for their weekend plan or made obligations otherwise that they need to keep.  The whole purpose of this incentive program was to get more designs done but due to how late in the week it was announced prevented the incentive from maximizing the amount of people it could have brought in.\\\\   For a different incentive program that was run in September a list of prizes that could be won.  This one also was announced late as the email that began it was sent out on the Monday it started at 9:05pm; pretty much making it so no one on either shift was really ready for it and the morning shift really missed out on being able to put in any extra time that Monday or the Tuesday afterward since they didn't receive the email until Tuesday morning making it impossible for them to get enough designs to qualify for any of the prizes they really wanted.  \\\\   Another thing that came out of the September incentive was that it wasn't announced that the winners of any of the prizes would have had to pay taxes on the prizes they won until November 24th when they were sent a tax form to fill out for the prizes they received.  The people on my team were understanding that it does fall into that area that they should need to pay taxes on it after I explained to them that it was what Vivint Solar was supposed to do and that other companies I had worked for also had prizes similar to what they received be considered taxable gifts; but, they were still upset about not being notified about it until almost two months after the September incentive had ended and they had already received their prizes.\\\\   So to really sum up the real long explanation of the above is that if there are changes or events that are needing to be done there should be given time between the approval of the change/event and to when that change/event is rolled out.",

I think that there is some frustration from a \"process\" standpoint  at the office level, but I believe that can be contributed to growing pains. \\\\Questions 2: \"I am committed to the company\" \\I had to answer Neither Agree no Disagree. I am nothing but committed to this company. However, I have tendered my resignation effective 12/31/2015 to pursue other opportunities. I felt that if I did not capitalize on this opportunity I would regret it in the long run. It was the hardest decision I have had to make. \\\\Questions 3: \"Pride\"\\I am incredibly proud to work here, I constantly dawn Vivint attire where ever I go. \\\\Question 4: \"Passion\" \\I love what Vivint is doing, and I love the people I work with,  that is one of the things that made my decision so difficult. \\\\Questions 5: \"Excited to work\" \\This is one of the only jobs I have ever had where I look forward to coming to work every morning. I love to problem solve.\\\\Questions 6: \"I am a part of the company\"\\I feel like Bruce Scott (Dir. Ops), Ed Quist(Reg. Ops MD), and Mark Toone (Dir. Sales) have done an amazing job including me on big decisions. I feel like my input is valued, which certainly makes me feel like I am apart of something here. This is another reason I love coming to work here. \\\\Question 7: \"Encourage others to join Vivint\"\\I personally relocated from FL to pursue a career with Vivint in MD. I have attempted to persuade others to join me but with no luck, that is a big move. I have tried to encourage everyone I have worked with here to pursue every opportunity they can with Vivint to further grow with the company. \\\\I hope this helps, feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or if you would like any more in put.",

            "Questions 4: \"Necessary Resources\"\\We deal with a great deal of information. Prior to the dashboard rolling out we were tracking all of our own metrics in Excel. I sent an extensive email to Dan Rock requesting an additional monitor, keyboard, and mouse to help with data entry and analysis. I felt like two screens was absolutely necessary. To my surprise my request was denied. Approximately a month later, I brought this up to our DMs (Jordan Laplace), without hesitation Jordan took care of the situation and ordered them for us and got it taken care of. He provided both my OM and myself with what we needed.\\\\Questions 7: \"Info from my direct supervisor\"\\My direct supervisor is in the midst of migrating to a new office. For a while we had no regional so I was relying on Bruce Scott (Dir. Ops) to keep me in the loop. He did all he could and did a good job. The additional of our new regional has greatly improved this process. \\\\Question 8: \"Regularly informed\"\\I hear more from word of mouth than actual emails. I am the Assistant OM for MD1. I rely on my OM for feedback. However, he is in the midst of relocating to another office. The hiring process for the new OM has been longer than I would have ever expected. Ed Quist has been vital in keeping me in the loop since he has joined the team. Go ED!!",

            "Each department is unified in itself. My previous department was solar solutions and we were a tiny team but we loved and helped out one another. We teamed up with billing and would help them out and they would do the same for us. It was awesome. I am with Electrical Service Change now and the team here is awesome also they are unified and though i still feel like the outcast because i am new to the team, it is ok i just have to remember to be a part of the team. \\The reason why I am sharing this with you is because everyone is team and loves their team but the company does not work as a team. It is because of this, that i was not able to mark any of my answers as \"strongly agree\". Inbound cares about inbound, fleet performance cares about fleet, billing only deals with billing, sales rep do not care about us they only want their install to go through. There are so many individuals that notice where money is being \"used up\" that want to prevent this from happening so profit and succeed. \\The two thing that i have since noticed being with Vivint Solar that need to change for vivint solar to succeed is unity as a company as a whole and policies to prevent the spending of money.",

            "Communication is key to any successful relationship.\\I have been to quite a few job interviews and have been given the job on the spot not because of my resume but because of my personality. I am passionate about my work and know that when i set my mind to it, i can accomplish anything.I do not take the all the credit when i succeed, i have to give credit to my team. For example i use to work for Macy's and i use to sell people on getting a Macy's credit card. I was good at my job but i was only good because my team would motivate me to continue performing and excelling at what i was doing. The company had a goal and they would let the stores know and the stores would let each person know what they expect from each person and each person was require to tell their supervisors what they expected from them to help them reach their goals and grow. In my current team we have weekly meeting on policies and procedures but i have not received an interview about my current performance and what they would like for me to do. In my previous position in solar solutions, My supervisor would say he would meet with us but he never did. I remember when he would meet with us, i would see what i was accomplishing and where i needed to improve on. He would check to make sure we were ok mentally, physically and emotionally. That is a true supervisor, someone that motivates their team and not just someone that deals with escalated customers or situations. Vivint Solar stated that they want to see people excel especially from within well what are they doing to help us accomplish such a thing? In order for someone to know how well he or she is doing they need the one on ones with their supervisors, team meeting need to consist of what we have done, what they want from us, how they want it done and what will this do if we do it. Team goals will motivate the team to strive for something each person given a goal to reach the team goal and the team goal will help contribute to the company goal.\\The company is public and we perform on a quarterly bases but what is wanted to be done for that quarter and how is each team going to contribute for that quarterly goal. What is being asked of me?\\I have never heard of what the company wants to accomplish that quarter and if the executives want to achieve something they need to notify us of what that is so we may know how we can contribute as a team and then as an individual.\\A quote from i love is \"by small and simple things are great things brought to pass.\"",
            "Do you know your employees? Do you know their names and interests? At the moment we are separated and you are located in lehi and i am in Orem. You are not able to come down here everyday and see us and get to know your employees that make Vivint Solar what it is. \\My name is Alan Cruz, I am from McKinney, Texas. I have a lovely wife whose name is Amanda Marie Cruz and she is from Clovis, CA and we have been married for almost a year on December 27, 2014. We posted a wedding announcement for everyone to see on my wall in my cubicle and handed some out through out the company and people posted them on their walls. I remember sending one to Mr. Butterfield and to the executives trying to see if i could get a gift for it but my wife said they are at the top of the totem pole they won't care about me since i am at the bottom. I looked at my wife and said \"they may be the gears of this operation but i am the oil that makes it smooth for them to operate. \" \\This year has been a hard one for my wife and i, My wife lost one of her grandmothers this year, i lost an aunt and a grandfather and my twin. We have been trying to have a baby but had two miscarriages  this year. The good news is that we are preganant right now and this baby looks like he is going to make it. My wife is at 16 weeks and counting.\\The reason why i am sharing this with you is because i think that as the executives of the company, i would like to know who you are and want you to know who i am. Again one of my favorite jobs was Macy's and they partner with some many people and one is Michael Kor and Tommy Hilfiger. I remember when The CEO of Bloomingdale, Michael Kor and Tommy Hilfiger came and wanted to meet our store. When asked why, they responded, \"we just wanted to meet the people that made Macy's and are making it a success\" They shook our hands and actually came around and met every department and saw was being done and gave their advice on how to make it better. It was awesome to hear what i was doing for the company and what we can do better. They came on someone's birthday also and brought that person a gift.\\Again, Communication is the key to any successful relationship.",

            "Over all I feel like this department does not have a set responsibility. We our always being updated on things that we're changed a week ago. For example a week ago we were all told the Payment team would be taking over the emails in a week. That next week I was still doing emails. I asked my Supervisor why we were still doing emails at the end of that week. She informed me then that we would have to finish catching up on emails before we sent that over the the payment team. We have over 500+ emails in our box it has been that way for the past 4 months. We have less workers than ever (5) and have more to do than I have ever had in this department. I understand we are having a lot of changes in our department but it would be nice to understand exactly what my supervisor and her bosses would like us to do. Just work on emails? Just work on our outbound calls? All the feed back I get is work on emails stop making calls, or work on outbound stop working on emails. We have been told in meetings by Cent with our supervisor there that our department should be working with our most escalated customers to help them and get them paid off. That is our responsibility. We our given  our escalated customers to work with but have no time to call out to them or help them because we are doing emails to paid off/happy customers and working on other departments mistakes. I'm here to work hard. I would just like some direction and to stop having my department be looked over. \\\\PS: For some reason we are filling out Volume Tracking sheets. These thing are horrible. I really like my supervisor but having someone peer over my shoulder to look at my numbers for the day is very annoying. Everyone in this department has been here for 6 months+ I feel like we all know how to do our jobs correctly and effectively. No one else in the company has to fill these out. I feel like I have a baby sitter rather than a boss. \\\\Like I said in the questions you asked I like coming to work. I like this job. I like my bosses. I just feel like we need improvements as quickly as possible so that we can work with the escalated customers to help them get paid off.",

Each week something exciting and new is announced and I have a huge sense of pride in what we do. I look forward to coming into work, which is not something I felt with other jobs. However, I sometimes feel that the OAs are forgotten about. For example, we were not included in the Megawatt trip until last minute. Even then, there is only one spot for an OA on the trip. We used to have a direct voice in the corporate office, but there is no one to really turn to at this point. Every OA I have met works as hard as possible, but it seems like we aren't a part of the team as much as sales or the tech side.",

It's not really detrimental, but it would be nice to streamline the system a bit. And to be able to customize Salesforce for individual offices (since each region has such different needs) would be very helpful. I also sometimes feel out of the loop for new information. The merger is something that is definitely a source of uncertainty, and, while I understand that not all information can be shared, it would be nice to have a little more reassurance on what to expect. Also, as an OA, I would really love to be able to give raises to my Permit Specialist, but I don't know who to turn to in order to request this. Since we are not part of one corporate office, it is more difficult to find answers on things like this. I sometimes feel like we are on our own to find out information to a certain extent (and as such, some misinformation is spread occasionally).",
            "Thank you for the weekly conference calls. They definitely help to keep us on the same page. I am very excited to work for this company, in a time where solar is just beginning to boom - it feels like being a little part of history. I love this company's culture and that we are still so young compared to many other companies, because it feels like each of us can make a difference, not just be bogged down by bureaucracy. I hope to stay at Vivint for a long time (a company 401k match would seriously help that as well!).",

It would be nice to have a structured idea of what it is specifically we are doing pertaining to our job titles. Also, rate of pay needs to be re-evaluated. An amount of money made in one state is not enough in another state. I think that that should be addressed so that we aren't stressing over our hourly pay. The amount alot of the employees are currently making aren't enough to live full lives effectively because we are living paycheck to paycheck, because the areas we live in in order to be close to the office have expensive rent. Some of us, live as far as an hour away from our offices and still struggle from day to day between paychecks.",

            "There are a few things that I'd like to express regarding the field and the difference I see from being on the corporate side and the field side.  There are times that things are expressed but have fallen on deaf ears.  Since working for Vivint Solar almost 3 years, I thought working at corporate was hard but seeing what I see out here in the field has brought everything to a whole new perspective.  Let it be known that I have loved working for Vivint Solar since beginning and I hold pride for this company although my faith as waiver a few times.  A few things below are what concerns me at the moment.\\\\1.  Workers are under appreciated by upper management.  Example:  Why is there only a $10/person budget for Christmas party/dinner?  How does that show any value to those who work the hardest for something they believe in?  \\2.  There's been a huge push to lower overtime hours but yet our reps are needing jobs on the board.  One moment we're asked to get everything installed then the next it's hold off cause we can't exceed 40 hours/week.  Sr of Operations says unlimited OT then it changes as it goes down the pipe.  Clear communication is always lost in the mix of things.\\3.  Corporate should take those who have experience (not a degree) in the field and utilize their knowledge to manage the office.  \\4.  There is a disconnect with the process between corporate and field.  There are some process' that need to be done in house as corporate does not know what goes on in the field (material availability, scheduling conflicts, manpower etc)\\\\There are more that can be shared but these are just a few.  I hope you can understand where I'm coming from.  I work with others who've come in from different companies i.e Solar City who's minds are blown with our process and communication to smoothly get our customers from sales to PTO.  Like I said before that I pride myself with Vivint Solar but it gets frustrating hearing these from others which has me questioning 'what are we doing and where are we going?'  \\\\Thanks for letting me have the mic.  Hopefully someone hears me.",

The job was described to me one way, and ended up being a lot different than what I originally thought. With that being the case, I know that this a good company with opportunities to move forward so I will continue to be committed to doing my job well. \\\\ Since I am fairly new to the company, it's hard to say whether we are moving in the right direction or not. It seems like a lot of things, such as the acquisition, are up in the air and there's no definite answers to questions that employees have. Once that is settled it will be easier to decide whether the company is moving in the right direction. I think the goals we have, with or without the acquisition, are good.\\\\In addition, I feel that I would be more passionate about the company if we practiced what we preached. For instance, we claim to be an environmentally friendly company yet we don't offer any public transportation assistance (i.e. Frontrunner passes, etc.), we don't recycle, and a ton of food is wasted after lunch, etc. I would take more pride in my work if I felt that the company was truly committed to helping the environment.",

            "I've felt a decline in motivation in recent months due to a lack of identity with the company and not being given a clear picture of who we are now, what the new outlook is with the merger and details of what changes are in store.  I am told to continue doing what I'm doing however I notice that what gave me motivation before was having a clear identity and feeling fully informed on what we are and what lies ahead.  For some reason those factors strongly influence my desire to perform, a higher purpose so to speak.  At times I feel in the dark and it is difficult to want to perform for anything when you feel in the dark.  I know we are headed for some good things, just would be nice to know what those are. Maybe a bit more of a rally as we join forces with a new company would be nice so we feel like a team as a whole again.  Also, the other thing that has influenced me to not be encouraging to family and friends about Vivint is the lack of action once an account is installed, getting that customer to the point of an operating system.  I feel there are too many different departments contributing to getting systems permission to operate, and too many individuals waiting on others for separate pieces of requirements- which seem to fall through the cracks and the customer is the one who ends up losing, when I tell them they will start saving money, they don't realize that it is going to take months and months to begin using their new system... It's discouraging and much of it is out of my control.  I feel as though much of my time is spend chasing down information rather than getting out there and getting new sign-ups, which is my best skill- when I get the chance to use it.

            "If I was taking this survey 60 days ago, I would have responded \"Strongly Agree\" to every statement. The challenges we've encountered with Baltimore County have been painful. I've not had a paycheck in over 2 months, and it appears that it will be at least another month before any money starts to flow again. I would have installed at least 150 kW this quarter. I have that much sitting in solids currently but have also lost a bunch of stuff because of the delays. I have so many unhappy customers, I literally am having a hard time sleeping at night. Secondly, and something I feel strongly about, the move to requiring the PPA upfront is, based on an analysis of my personal experiences, a mistake. Or, at least, should be done on a case by case basis. Or Reps with a track-record should be allowed to progress accounts with just the PCCF and usage. When I was getting everything up front, my cancels were higher. With just the PCCF, and then showing my face at the Site Survey, and then coming back with the CAD, I was building lots of credibility and rapport. When it comes time for the PPA etc, it flows and isn't forced. With everything up front, after leaving, people often \"feel sold\" and had second thoughts about this 20 year agreement, and cancelled. I think we are going in the wrong direction here. Furthermore, several of the solar companies in the area, that we are now competing against, don't require the PPA prior to having a site assessment done. So, we are taking a turn for the worse here competitively. Lastly, I'm very passionate about solar energy. Our family built our own solar hot water back in 1972. This is a cause I feel very strongly about and why I made, what was a pretty major career decision to come to Vivint. In all the various marketing endeavors over the years I've generally earned in the 300-400K a year range. I thought I could do that with Vivint, but am having a hard time seeing that right now. But also as a footnote, I've probably only been able to operate at 50% of my ability due to family health issues. My 94 year old Mom is in her last days, in and out of the hospital more times than I can count the last 6 months, and my wife of 34 years has Leukemia. So, it hasn't been the best of days for me personally which has greatly impacted my productivity with Vivint.",

            "The company feels very \"sales centric.\" Sales seems to get what they want, even when it is not in the best interested of the business. From covering areas too large to operate efficiently in, despite operations protests, to forcing installs on roofs that will likely leak there are a lot of things that get pushed through that ultimately hurt the company. There also seems to be a double standard of accountability. Sales persons who commit forgery, fraud and outright lie to customers somehow keep their jobs (\"get internet until you have PTO, then cancel it). We seem to spend much more on sales incentives, videos, training, social media videos etc. I would love nothing more than to see us truly unified across the company, but until the special treatment ends, it won't happen. This general feeling of team sales and ops, instead of team VSLR, the attitude of whats best for me (closing a sale) vs whats best for the company (installing a profitable account), is the biggest reason I answered as I did above.",

That being said I am more than fairly compensated for my work, but the efficiency of this company is probably less than half of what it could be.  Considering it is a 5 year old project that is not terribly bad, but there is room to grow in communication and efficiency in my opinion.",

(just my opinion).\\\\I enjoy working for Vivint Solar.  I think that the name change to GO Solar is brilliant!\\\\I am concerned about my surveyors at the moment.  They have low survey volume due to low sales.  Now with the new rules on surveying with a signed PPA, volume will no doubt take another hit.  We will probably be overstaffed.  \\\\I know a lot about the importance of cost/watt, but I don't think that the average employee knows much at all.  It is of the utmost importance!  (I talk to my 3 year old like she is a mature little person, not a baby... She doesn't act like a baby any longer).  I think that we need to treat the employees like adults and team members and talk to them on an adult level about why cutting costs is so important.  The ones who take it seriously and strive to cut costs after knowing the importance are ultimately the ones that we want on our team.

            "Leadership at the company is very immature. This leads to bad decisions in regard to legal compliance, financial decisions, training, etc.\\\\We raised millions of dollars in our IPO,  we were told that would cover our G&A activities until 2018, yet we burned through that money  with incentives, bad sales programs, out of control overtime, etc. We talk about being good and doing good, but what are we doing? We don't have charity programs or service activities. I see lots of activities that seem to waste resources and money with no real impact to installation, sales, or employee morale. We were promised a 401k match in 2015 and that hasn't happened. \\\\I believe in the business model and what we sell as a product, but we seem to have no direction internally to sell the company to the employees and involve all employees in the progress toward goals.\\\\My annual bonus is tied to the performance and spending of other departments; departments whose own bonuses are not dependent on meeting the same metrics. Not all departments are eligible for the POM program. \\\\When applying for a promotion and the process was 99% complete, including approval of my manager and managers manager, company policy was changed to preclude me from getting said promotion.\\\\The acquisition has been a giant black hole for the organization from lack of communication with what is happening, employees leaving due to lack of communication, hiring/promotion freeze, etc. \\\\Overall, I think we can go places and do good things, but that requires more than a few pictures around the office and saying the words. We need some real morale boosting",

In reference to poor leadership, I would like to specifically call out Tessa White, the current VP of HR. It is obvious to everyone who works with her (directly and indirectly) that she is not qualified for the role she is in, nor is she an effective manager of people and processes. Many of the decisions and mistakes she has made has negatively affected the organization and is the main reason for abrupt the exit of employees in her department.\\\\As for the Sun Edison merger, it appears \u200bthis was a bad decision from the beginning.

            "If our task were likened to finding and chopping down trees (as sales), it has felt like we have been given a very dull ax to do the task (if the ax were operations running smoothly).  I feel like I could have chopped down twice as many trees in my 18 mos. with the company if the ax had been sharpened more - with the same or less effort. We've been promised help and improvement - hopefully this time it comes so we can more effectively complete our task, help our customers, and continue to change the world.",
            "One thing that I've felt would be valuable in my time with the company, is a way to get ideas/suggestions from the front lines to places/people where they can be heard and possibly implemented in order to benefit us as a whole. I believe many great ideas can surface from the front lines - we are dealing directly with customers and roadblocks in distributing our product. However, it feels when these ideas/suggestions come up they have no where to go and be heard (even as a DM). \\\\For example - we have a newer rep in our office who is retired, and spent 30+ years as a lean process/manufacturing engineer for his career. His brain is full of ways that could help our operations be more lean and efficient; as he is seeing what is happening first hand. He has come to me with suggestions, many of which I think are great - I have tried to get them somewhere to help but they don't seem close to getting where they would need to go for proper implementation. \\\\It's understandable that every suggestion won't work/benefit the company, but it could prove very useful to implement a better way for suggestions to be heard, and maybe some new ideas will arise that can help transform our company into a more efficient, lean, and effective machine.  \\\\Thank you for personally reaching out for our input- I believe in our mission as a company and in you as our leader!",

Estimating an average pay of $12 for the designers here would be $24,960 annually.

It is an amazing necessary change in the way we power our world and I actually started with Vivint because I got installed to lower my personal carbon foot print and I thought it would be amazing to help others do the same while saving them money at the same time. I'm hopeful to get out there with full confidence again and to see improvement in these areas, when that happens: sky's the limit for us, customer & employee satisfaction will be through the roof and the business will grow so much faster because referrals, reviews & word of mouth should be launching us forward not holding us back",

I have been with Vivint for a long time and my hesitation to encourage people to work for us or offer our service to those I know comes from the lack of follow through and accountability others are held to. I have years of experience in the trades as an electrician and I cannot speak for other offices but for the market where I work, it is clear that the local operations manager is not in that position due to merit, qualification or hard work. He had been less than helpful in any regard to my accounts and I have had to work directly with the sales manager to get things taken care of for my customers. Someone in that position should be there more that just to collect a check. I don't know if the situation locally is a reflection of the company as a whole, but the lack of interest in correcting issues as they come up makes it difficult not to think that there is a genuine disinterest in the success of the individual sales people or the customers we work with.",

It seems that numbers rule my life now and that it's all I can do to not be written up for not getting my team to work harder.  I feel so much more scrutinized for my small mistakes, than I do lauded for my achievements.  There's so much pressure to be perfect and to not let anything slack that I'm starting to feel anxiety about just coming to work.  \\\\Granted, I know some of these things are just natural symptoms of growing and becoming a corporate powerhouse, but still - I don't feel like Vivint Solar is on my side anymore.

            "I'm excited to be part of the energy revolution that is taking place and enjoy the hard work and challenges we take on.  Although here would be concerns I have... I like this forum because many times one feels they can't say what their thinking in fear to be seen as negative or not on board. I'm on board and very loyal to the company.\\ If I was to ask executives why should a customer go with Vivint I would be curious to hear the answer. In fact that would be my challenge before your next Monday call, ask that question and see if the answer is true or not or based on the reviews given by customers is what they said true. Better panels? Supreme service? Better price? Better program? Better sales reps? Easy process to go from sale to install.. Because I think we're getting best on all fronts.\\- our pto times are crazy slow, 6 months plus to get a customer turned on and we didn't do anything for that customer.  No call saying hey will give a month free etc.  we waited till they called in or the sales rep paid out of pocket to calm them down.  Processing paperwork takes multiple attempts on many occasions.  We've had customers who have had damage to their homes meaning a leak and ceiling covered in water Stain and take over 6 months to get it fixed.  Those small battles we're losing.  In 4 years we still don't have a clean system down that doesn't lose customers along the way.  our managers are not doing a good job training reps. They hire, train, manage others accounts and manage their own.  Priority being on their own,  they can't slow down to fix problems because slowing down would be seen as not producing and not working not creating new accounts. I know some as dm  who not one time went and helped another close a cad that wasn't their own.  They are spread to thin and in return do a mediocre job at all.  We mock solar city because they don't want their Dms sole focus to be personal accounts and then do programs such as mentor program that shines a light on how many accounts are stuck because they don't know how to move them.  But the amount of work it takes to micro manage an account from sale to pto which all falls on the rep takes a lot of time.  we should be focused on how can we get our solar reviews from a 1 star to a 5 star and how can we get a rep to know what he's doing.  We have some of the most talented people working for us but there is a large disconnect from Corp to the field in what is seen on a spreadsheet to be happening and the actual process it takes to get a customer through our process.  I've seen some from Corp go out for a day and follow a rep.  But that rep was either a leader or wasn't going to talk about how hard it is to get through the process.  I know we are working on solutions for everything I've listed.  I do feel like the people working on them haven't been in the field and don't realize the pressure of going back to a customers home after we haven't provided them a good service, and while we're focusing on getting the next install and leaving the other behind we don't realize when providing a bad service were in turn making it harder and harder to get new sales.  We make policy like payments and contracts signed thinking that will make better accounts, while I agree that helps, what would really help is after someone just signed a 20 year ppa after only knowing someone for 30 min and googled Vivint solar it was good news they found not bad.    All in all I'm excited and know this is the right place to be, I live everyday for the challenge, but there is some large holes to be filled. I love the people I work with and am excited to win, but I believe our arrogance is hurting us and not allowing us to see the small things that matter.  I am very grateful for you and also know there are many at Corp who are working endless hours to help us and I really appreciate that.  Truthfully I'm grateful to have a job with Vivint solar.",

I understand that some things are outside of our control and it is difficult to foresee that such things will delay or stop our growth (i.e. net metering laws, permit approvals, etc.); however, we are quickly moving in to new areas with the intent to earn more money and business but end up spending more than we receive (i.e. Las Vegas or South Carolina). Although I'm excited that we are growing, I also feel that we should first strengthen those areas where we are currently present and have already established a reputation. I think the same thing can be said about our constantly changing compensation plans and new sales channels. I feel that we make decisions without first figuring out how it's all going to work. I feel that we, as the saying goes, will \"put the cart before the horse.\" This, in turn, causes additional manual work for those supporting groups. I feel that some stress could be reduced if decisions were made with more analysis of the opportunities and threats as well as defining the processes. Again, all this is said through my perspective and without the whole picture. This is just my findings based on my work load and perspective.",

I feel that some additional training and defining of roles can be done on the sales end (i.e. DMs and DDMs) because I don't feel that the chain of command is followed very often when dealing with problems. Often, have I found, that problems will be escalated to the VP's without first being worked through with direct supervisors. I understand that it could be the culture of the sales environment. It would be beneficial if the company offered classes (i.e. Excel Analytic's, VBA, Excel Statistics, etc.) that would help us be more proficient at our jobs. I enjoy learning new skills and would take advantage of such classes. I understand that I may be in the minority though.",
            "I appreciate you offering a way for us to provide feedback. I sincerely hope that you understand that I am not trying to be critical. I think that the company does a lot of things well. I have also began to recognize some of our weaknesses. I am committed to turning our weaknesses into strengths but we all need to recognize them. I feel that to many decisions are driven off of sales department. Again, my perspective is limited. Thank you and have a great day!",
